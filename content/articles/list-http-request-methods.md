You may have heard about the different HTTP request methods, but what are they, and how do they differ? In this article you will find a list of all HTTP request methods, their definitions, and their use cases.

## What is an HTTP request method?

An **HTTP request method** (or verb) is a part of the HTTP protocol that indicates the desired action to be performed on a specific resource identified by a URL. Each method has a specific meaning and is used for different purposes in web communication.
HTTP request methods are used in RESTful APIs to define the type of operation to be performed on the resources. They are part of the HTTP protocol, which is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web.

To learn more about HTTP methods and REST APIs, you can read our [API guide part 2: REST(ful) APIs](/articles/api-guide-rest-api-components/).

## List of HTTP request methods

Here is a nearly exhaustive list of HTTP request methods, their definitions, and their use cases. Note that some methods are less commonly used or specific to certain protocols or applications.

### PUT

The **PUT** method is used to create or update a resource at a specified URI. It allows clients to send the entire representation of a resource in the request body. If the resource already exists, it will be replaced; if it does not exist, it will be created. Example: `PUT /api/v1/users/123` with a body containing the user data.

### QUERY

**[New proposal, not yet standardized](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpbis-safe-method-w-body/)**

The **SUBSCRIBE** method is used to subscribe to notifications or events related to a resource. It allows clients to receive updates or alerts when changes occur to a resource, such as modifications or new versions.

### TRACE

The **TRACE** method is used to perform a diagnostic trace of the request path. It allows clients to see the exact request and response headers as they are sent and received by the server. It is primarily used for debugging purposes.

### UNBIND

**[Specific to WebDAV](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5842)**

The **UNBIND** method is used to remove a binding of a resource from a specific URI. It allows clients to delete the association between a resource and its URI without affecting the resource itself.

### UNCHECKOUT

**[Specific to WebDAV](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3253)**

The **UNCHECKOUT** method is used to cancel a checkout operation on a version-controlled resource. It allows clients to discard changes made during a checkout and revert the resource to its previous state.

### UNSUBSCRIBE

**Specific to WebDAV**

The **UNSUBSCRIBE** method is used to cancel a subscription to notifications or events related to a resource. It allows clients to stop receiving updates or alerts when changes occur to a resource.

### UPDATE

**[Specific to WebDAV](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3253)**

The **UPDATE** method is used to modify a version-controlled resource. It allows clients to apply changes to a resource without creating a new version, typically used in conjunction with version control systems.

### UPDATEREDIRECTREF

**[Specific to WebDAV](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4437)**

The **UPDATEREDIRECTREF** method is used to update a redirect reference to a resource. It allows clients to change the target URI of a redirect reference, enabling redirection to a different resource.

### VERSION-CONTROL

**[Specific to WebDAV](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3253)**

The **VERSION-CONTROL** method is used to create a new version-controlled resource. It allows clients to initiate version control for a resource, enabling tracking of changes and versions over time.

### Custom HTTP request methods?

While the methods listed above are standardized and widely used, it is possible to define custom HTTP request methods for specific applications or protocols. However, custom methods should be used with caution, as they may not be supported by all clients or servers and can lead to compatibility issues.
