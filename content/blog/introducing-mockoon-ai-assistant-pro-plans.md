## 📢 Announcing the Pro plans

We are excited to announce the launch of [Mockoon Pro plans](/pro/), marking a significant milestone in our journey as an open-source project. At Mockoon, we have always been dedicated to providing powerful and user-friendly tools for API mocking and testing, made available freely under an open-source license to the developers' community.

Introducing Mockoon Pro plans stems from our commitment to expanding the project's scope while ensuring its long-term viability. By offering paid products and services, we aim to find a balance between an open-source core and providing advanced features and enterprise-level services for those who desire an even more powerful API mocking and prototyping experience.

This significant step will allow us to secure the project's sustainability and continue serving developers worldwide with the same dedication.

## 🤖 AI assistant and templates

The first feature part of our Pro plans is an [AI assistant](/ai-powered-api-mocking/) that helps you generate realistic templates for your endpoints, accompanied by a range of [hand-curated JSON templates](/templates/). This functionality empowers solo developers and teams to accelerate the prototyping process.

This feature is not only designed to enhance API prototyping but also serves as an invaluable tool for teaching and learning API concepts. It makes Mockoon Pro the perfect companion for educators, trainers, and anyone seeking to teach or grasp the intricacies of APIs.

Behind the scenes, our AI assistant leverages OpenAI's Chat GPT. We have fine-tuned the prompt specifically for Mockoon, enabling the generation of complex and realistic JSON structures using Handlebars templating and Faker.js helpers. This integration empowers developers to effortlessly create realistic and dynamic mock endpoints, reducing development time and simplifying the process of prototyping their APIs.
