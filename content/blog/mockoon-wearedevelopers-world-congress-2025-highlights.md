## By the Numbers

Over the course of July 10-11, we:

- **Conducted dozens of live demos** showcasing Mockoon's capabilities. üé¨
- **Met hundreds of developers** from around the world. üåç
- **Had in-depth discussions** about API mocking, QA workflows, and developer productivity. üßë‚Äçüíª
- **Connected with fellow open source maintainers** at the GitHub booth. ü§ù
- **Met some die-hard Mockoon fans** who shared their experiences and use cases. üôè
- **Distributed tons of stickers and sweets to attendees**. üç¨

Seeing the excitement and interest in Mockoon was truly rewarding. Many developers were surprised by how easy it is to create realistic mock APIs with our tool, and we received valuable feedback on features they would like to see in future releases.

## Key Conversations and Insights

Throughout our time at the conference, we had interesting discussions about:

- **API Mocking in Modern Development**: Developers shared their pain points with traditional API mocking approaches and were excited to see how Mockoon simplifies the process. Many were surprised by the speed and ease of creating realistic mock APIs.

- **QA Workflows and Testing**: QA teams and test engineers were particularly interested in how Mockoon can **streamline their testing workflows**. We demonstrated how teams can create consistent, reliable test environments without depending on external services.

- **Developer Onboarding**: One of the most common themes was **better developer onboarding**. Teams struggle with getting new developers up and running quickly.Mockoon's ability to provide instant, working APIs for frontend development resonated strongly with engineering managers and team leads.

- **Workflow Optimization**: We had great conversations about **streamlining development workflows** and reducing friction in the development process. Many developers were excited about how Mockoon could eliminate bottlenecks in their daily work.

## GitHub Open Source Friday Interview

Despite nearly losing my voice from conducting dozens of demos over two days, we were thrilled to participate in [GitHub's **Open Source Friday** livestream with Andrea Griffiths](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2FQVBmBttY). The interview was a fantastic opportunity to share Mockoon's story with a broader audience and discuss the importance of developer tooling in the open source ecosystem.

## GitHub Open Source Spotlight

Being part of GitHub's **Open Source Spotlight** was truly special. We shared the booth with other incredible open source projects:

- [**Cilium**](https://cilium.io/): a cloud native solution for providing, securing, and observing network connectivity.
- [**Image Glass**](https://imageglass.org/): a lightweight, versatile image viewer.
- [**Kestra**](https://kestra.io/): a workflow orchestration platform.
- [**Ladybird Browser**](https://ladybird.org/): an independent web browser.
- [**Qrisp**](https://qrisp.eu/index.html): a high-level programming language for creating and compiling quantum algorithms.

It was interesting to see the diversity of open source projects represented at the booth, each showcasing unique solutions and the power of community collaboration.
