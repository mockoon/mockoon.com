We're excited to announce that [Mockoon will be at **WeAreDevelopers World Congress** in Berlin](https://www.linkedin.com/events/7346085387313856512/comments/) this year! With over 15,000 developers expected, this is one of the world's largest gatherings of software professionals and we're thrilled to be part of it.

## Live from the GitHub Booth

Mockoon has been invited to join the **GitHub booth (2_59, Level 2)** as part of their **Open Source Spotlight**.

Our founder, Guillaume, we'll be there on **July 10 and 11**, showcasing how **Mockoon makes API mocking easier, faster, and more powerful** for developers and QA teams alike. He will be available for live demos, discussions, and to answer any questions you have about Mockoon and how it can fit into your development workflows.
