Open-source maintainers are the unsung heroes of the software world, dedicating their time and effort to building and maintaining the tools we all rely on. We are excited to announce our partnership with GitHub for the **Maintainer Month** initiative, which aims to support them and their projects. This month-long celebration is dedicated to recognizing the hard work of maintainers and providing them with the resources they need to thrive.

## What is Maintainer Month?

Maintainer Month is an initiative by GitHub to celebrate and support the incredible work of open-source maintainers worldwide. Open-source projects are the backbone of the software industry, and maintainers play a crucial role in ensuring their success. This month-long event is dedicated to recognizing their efforts and providing resources to help them thrive.

## GitHub and the Maintainer Month Accelerator

GitHub, the world's leading platform for software development and collaboration, has launched the Maintainer Month Accelerator to provide maintainers with tools, resources, and partnerships to support their projects. This program is designed to empower maintainers and ensure the sustainability of their open-source contributions. Read more about the [GitHub Accelerator program](/blog/github-accelerator/).

## Mockoon: Open-Source and Independent

Mockoon is proud to be an open-source and independent API mocking platform. Our mission has always been to support developers and the open-source community by providing reliable and easy-to-use tools. We believe in the power of open-source to drive innovation and collaboration, and we are committed to giving back to the community that has supported us.

## Our Partnership with GitHub

As part of the Maintainer Month initiative, we are thrilled to partner with GitHub to offer free Mockoon Cloud accounts to open-source project maintainers. This is an ideal solution for maintainers who need reliable API mocks and collaboration tools to streamline their workflows. By providing free access to Mockoon Cloud, we aim to empower maintainers with the tools they need to build, test, and collaborate more effectively.

## Why This Matters

Supporting open-source projects is essential for fostering innovation and collaboration in the tech community. Maintainers often work tirelessly to keep their projects alive, and they deserve all the support they can get. By participating in Maintainer Month, we hope to contribute to the sustainability and growth of open-source projects.
