Open-source maintainers are the **unsung heroes of the software world**, dedicating their time and effort to building and maintaining the tools we all rely on. We are excited to announce our partnership with GitHub for the **Maintainer Month** initiative, which aims to support them and their projects.

## What is Maintainer Month?

**Maintainer Month** is an initiative by GitHub to **celebrate** and **support** the incredible work of open-source maintainers worldwide. Open-source projects are the **backbone of the software industry**, and **maintainers play a crucial role** in ensuring their success. This month-long event is dedicated to recognizing their efforts and providing resources to help them thrive.
This year, for the fourth edition of Maintainer Month, the theme is **Securing Open Source**. Raising awareness about the importance of security and ongoing maintenance in open-source projects is crucial to ensuring their **longevity** and **reliability**.

The month is paved with events, discussions, and resources to help maintainers improve their projects and connect with the community. Have a look at the [Maintainer Month website](https://maintainermonth.github.com/) for more information on the events and resources available.

## Mockoon and open-source <3

Mockoon is proud to be an **open-source and independent API mocking platform** since 2017 (damn we are old!). Our mission has always been to **support developers** and the open-source community by providing reliable and easy-to-use tools. We believe in the power of open-source to drive innovation and collaboration.

While maintaining an open-source tool is a **challenging task**, both technically and financially, we are committed to [keeping Mockoon open-source and free](/blog/our-commitment-open-source-community/) while finding [**sustainable ways to continue our work**](/blog/seven-years-2024-retrospective/#mockoon-cloud-and-the-path-to-sustainability).

Now that we are starting to see some great results with [Mockoon Cloud](/cloud/), we want to start **giving back** to the community. That's why we are excited to participate in Maintainer Month and support open-source maintainers.
