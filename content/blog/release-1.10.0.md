Welcome to this new release of Mockoon. There are several bug fixes and new features in this version that we hope you will like:

## New features 

- A JSON body sample is now generated during a Swagger/OpenAPI file import when a schema is present. (Issue #288) 
- Response rules can now be interpreted as OR or AND. (Issue #201)
- Rules can now check JSON bodies number and boolean values. (Issue #321)
- Two new helpers are available in the templating system: `newline`, which inserts the newline character "\n", and `base64` inline or block helper to encode all your stuffs. For more information, please refer to the official [documentation](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/overview/). (Issue #331)

## Bug fixes

- Fix an issue where some helpers (`queryParam`, `body`, etc) couldn't be used as `switch` helper value. (Issue #325)
- Fix crash when importing Swagger files where the `host` property is missing. (Issue #326)
- Binary files are now properly sent instead of being converted to strings. (Issue #324)
- Windows-like file path (with backslashes) are now compatible with templating helpers `C:\Users\username\Desktop\{{ urlParam 'id' }}.json`. (Issue #323)
- The environment's logs layout is not broken anymore when displaying long binary bodies. (Issue #335)
- Fixed a silent error when export dialog was canceled. (Issue #337)

## UI improvements

- Export menu items are now disabled when there is no environment to export. (Issue #336)
- Route path input now autofocus after adding a new route. (Issue #334)
- Mockoon has a new fancy loading screen ðŸ‘€ to avoid content flickering during load.

## Misc

- Work has started on the CLI (mainly refactoring), but shhh ðŸ¤« don't say it too loud, there is still a long way to go!
