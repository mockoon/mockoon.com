Welcome to this new release of Mockoon. There are several bug fixes and new features in this version that we hope you will like. But first some news: 
- There is a new [tutorials section](https://mockoon.com/tutorials/) on the website, where you will be able to learn new mocking tricks. 
- The development of the CLI started and is progressing well (we already have a basic version working internally, yay!). It required some heavy refactoring tackled in this version. 
- We can now say "we" for real as a second maintainer joined the team for twice the throughput ðŸš€. You can follow [Fabrice](https://github.com/fabhoarau) on GitHub ðŸŽ‰.

And now the changelog:

### New features 

- Route responses can now be randomized. This option available next to the route responses list will have priority over the rules. As a consequence, the CORS icon changed to reuse the "shuffle" icon for this feature. (Issue #269)
- Valid MongoDB ObjectIds can now be generated with a new `objectId` helper. See the [templating documentation](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/overview/) for more information. (Issue #342)
- The export menu has a new option to export the currently selected environment only. (Issue #251)
- Environments can now be started/stopped all at once with a new menu option (`Action` -> `Start/stop/reload all environments`). (Issue #90)

### Improvements

- When auto-mocking from the environment logs, the API prefix is no longer part of the newly created route path. (Issue #333)

### Bug fixes

- Fix automated tests not running correctly due to the newly added splash screen. (Issue #341)
- Fix broken layout in some rare cases due to usage of responsive row/col. (Issue #365)

### Misc

- Update Mockoon to Electron 10. (Issue #350)
- Update automated tests to Spectron 12 to improve the tests stability. (Issue #350)
- Project was migrated from TSlint to ESlint, in order to reuse the configuration for the `commons` library and the future CLI. (Issue #360)
- Current application and future CLI's shared code have been extracted in a [new library](https://github.com/mockoon/commons). (Issue mockoon/commons#1).
