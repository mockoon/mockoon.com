We are issuing a security advisory to inform our community about a **vulnerability**, identified as [**CVE-2025-59049**](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59049) and initially reported through GitHub Security Advisories ([GHSA-w7f9-wqc4-3wxr](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/security/advisories/GHSA-w7f9-wqc4-3wxr)), that has been discovered and subsequently patched in all Mockoon applications as part of release [**`9.2.0`**](/releases/9.2.0/#fixes).

## Summary

The vulnerability allows for **path traversal** and **local file inclusion (LFI)** through insecure template helpers. An attacker could craft a malicious Mockoon data file that, when loaded by a user, could allow access to sensitive files on the user's machine.

## How does the vulnerability work?

The [file serving](/docs/latest/response-configuration/file-serving/) feature in Mockoon allows users to **serve files from their local filesystem** as part of their mock API responses. It also **supports [templating helpers](/docs/latest/response-configuration/file-serving/#file-input-templating)**, allowing dynamic path generation based on request data or other variables.

Files can be served using absolute or relative paths, resolved from the data file location.

A file input containing a template like `./{{queryParam 'path'}}` or `../../../passwd` could be exploited by an attacker to perform path traversal attacks and serve sensitive files from the user's filesystem in the mock API responses.

The vulnerability was patched by **preventing path escaping from the data file directory**, ensuring that only files within the data file directory (and its subdirectories) can be served.

## Is my infrastructure at risk?

While the severity of this vulnerability is high, the **exploit probability is low**.

For the vulnerability to be exploited, a user must either:

- **import and run a mock API from a data file containing a malicious file path** (dynamic or not) and **expose it** to untrusted users, or
- create a data file with a **dynamic file path** (using templating helpers) and **expose it** to untrusted users.

However, we strongly recommend all users to update, especially for mock APIs publicly exposed.

> ðŸ”’ Our **Mockoon Cloud services were never at risk**, as file serving is not available yet for Cloud instances.

## Affected versions

All applications are affected up to and including version `9.1.0`:

- [**Desktop application**](/download/).
- [**CLI**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mockoon/cli) (`@mockoon/cli`).
- [**Serverless library**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mockoon/serverless) (`@mockoon/serverless`).
- [**Commons server library**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mockoon/commons-server) (used in all the other applications) (`@mockoon/commons-server`).

## Patched versions

The vulnerability has been fixed in version [**`9.2.0`**](/releases/9.2.0/) for all applications.

We urge all users to **update to version `9.2.0` or newer immediately**. You can [download the latest desktop version](/download/) or update the CLI and Serverless packages from NPM: `npm install @mockoon/cli@latest`
