We're thrilled to announce that **Mockoon is now officially listed on OpenPledge**! This partnership marks another important milestone in our journey toward **sustainable open-source development** and opens exciting new ways for our community to support the tool they rely on daily.

## Building a sustainable open-source project

We've talked about it before, but **sustainability is a tough challenge** for open-source projects. Over the past eight years, we've built a **desktop application used by tens of thousands of developers**, created a comprehensive CLI, and provided community support, all while keeping the core completely free.

But **passion projects need to become sustainable projects** if they're going to thrive long-term. Along the years, we've explored various ways to support our work: [sponsorships](https://github.com/sponsors/mockoon), [enterprise support](/cloud/), [training](/training/), [custom services](/custom-services/) and more recently [Mockoon Cloud](/cloud/). We've seen great success with this approach, especially with the launch of Mockoon Cloud last year, but we want to go further and offer more ways for our community to support us.

## Why OpenPledge?

**OpenPledge represents something unique**. Instead of generic donations, supporters can [**pledge on specific issues**](https://openpledge.io/) that matter to their business. This creates a direct connection between user needs and development priorities, with full transparency on where money goes.

It also makes it easier for companies to **justify supporting open-source projects** like Mockoon, as they can see the direct impact of their contributions.

Using OpenPledge is also very straightforward. After **connecting your GitHub account**, you can **browse Mockoon's issues** and **pledge any amount** to the ones you care about. Once an issue is sufficiently funded, we can prioritize it in our development cycle.

## Multiple ways to support Mockoon

Whether you're an individual developer who loves Mockoon or a company that depends on it, there are multiple ways to support our journey:

- **[Try Mockoon Cloud](/cloud/)** for team collaboration features and enterprise support.
- **[Pledge on OpenPledge](https://app.openpledge.io/repositories/mockoon/mockoon)** to support specific features that matter to your workflow.
- **[Sponsor us](https://github.com/sponsors/mockoon)** through our traditional sponsorship program.
- **[Contribute on GitHub](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon)** or share your joy for Mockoon with friends and colleagues.

The open-source ecosystem thrives when projects find sustainable paths forward. By diversifying our funding sources, we're proving that **open-source projects can be both community-driven and sustainable**.
