We are proud to announce that **Mockoon has officially endorsed the United Nations Open Source Principles**. This is more than a signature for us, it's a **reaffirmation of our core identity** and the values that have guided us since 2017.

## Why this matters to us

When we started Mockoon eight years ago, our vision was simple yet ambitious: **create the best API mocking tool that would be free, open-source, and accessible to every developer**. We believed then, as we do now, that essential developer tools should be transparent, collaborative, and available to all, regardless of budget or company size.

Endorsing the UN Open Source Principles feels like coming full circle. It's a **public commitment to the values that have always been at our core** and a way to stand with other organizations who believe in building technology for the public good.

By endorsing these principles, we're joining an impressive group of **60+ organizations worldwide** that share our commitment to open-source values. From major foundations like MariaDB and OpenSSL to innovative projects like Joomla! and emerging organizations, this diverse community represents the breadth and strength of the open-source ecosystem.

What excites us most is being part of a movement that extends beyond just software, it's about **fostering trust, innovation, and collaboration** on a global scale. The fact that governments, foundations, and companies are coming together around these principles shows that open-source has truly become a cornerstone of modern technology.

## How we already live these principles

The eight UN Open Source Principles aren't just aspirational for us, they're principles we've been **practicing throughout Mockoon's journey**:

**Open by default**: Since day one, Mockoon's core has been completely open-source. Every feature, bug fix, and improvement is developed in the open on GitHub.

**Contribute back**: We try to contribute to other open-source projects we depend on as much as possible, whether through code or by reporting issues and suggesting improvements.

**Secure by design**: Security isn't an afterthought, we build it into every aspect of Mockoon, from our desktop application to our cloud platform.

**Foster inclusive participation and community building**: Our community welcomes developers of all backgrounds and skill levels. We provide multiple ways to contribute, from code to documentation to community support.

**Design for reusability**: Mockoon works across platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux) and integrates seamlessly with existing development workflows through our CLI, Docker image, and cloud platform.

**Provide documentation**: We invest heavily in comprehensive documentation, tutorials, and examples to help users get the most out of Mockoon.

**RISE (recognize, incentivize, support and empower)**: We actively recognize and support our community contributors, providing them with the tools and platform to make meaningful contributions.

**Sustain and scale**: Our hybrid model, free open-source tool plus [Mockoon Cloud](/cloud/), ensures we can continue developing and supporting Mockoon for years to come.

This endorsement strengthens our resolve to continue on the path we've always been on. As we grow [Mockoon Cloud](/cloud/), **our open-source foundation remains non-negotiable**. We're committed to **keeping Mockoon's desktop application completely free and open-source** and **maintaining transparent development** where our community can see, contribute to, and influence our roadmap.

The truth is, we wouldn't be here without our incredible community. Every GitHub star, every bug report, every feature request, and every contribution has shaped what Mockoon is today. Your continued support validates our belief that developer tools should be **community-driven, transparent, and accessible to all**. Together, we're proving that sustainable open-source projects can thrive while serving the greater good.
