# Discover Mockoon Cloud

---

[Mockoon Cloud](/cloud/) is a set of features that allows you to **deploy your mock APIs in the cloud**, **synchronize your data across your team**, and **collaborate on your mock API projects**.

Mockoon Cloud features are available in the [desktop](/download/) and [web](https://app.mockoon.com) applications and are part of the Mockoon Cloud paid plans. Read on to learn how to use it and the different features it offers.

## Features

- **[Web application](cloud-docs:web-application)**: Access your mock APIs and collaborate on them using the Mockoon Cloud web application, without installing the desktop application.
- **[API mock deployments](cloud-docs:api-mock-cloud-deployments)**: Deploy your mock APIs in the cloud and share them with your team, clients, or class.
- **[Data synchronization and team collaboration](cloud-docs:data-synchronization-team-collaboration)**: Synchronize your mock APIs in the cloud, share them with your team, and collaborate in real time.
- **[AI assistants](cloud-docs:templates-and-ai-assistant)**: Use our AI assistants to generate realistic mock data and HTTP endpoints.

## Getting started

To use Mockoon Cloud features, you need to **create a Mockoon Cloud account** and [**subscribe to a paid plan**](/cloud/). You can then **log in** to the desktop application and start using the features.

Follow our [getting started guide](/tutorials/getting-started-with-mockoon-cloud/) to learn how to setup your account and start using Mockoon Cloud.

## Desktop application release table

While the **web application is always up-to-date**, we recommend using the latest version of the desktop application to ensure compatibility with Mockoon Cloud features. We usually support the two latest major versions of the desktop application, but some features may require a more recent version. You will be informed inside the application if you need to update it to connect to the Cloud.

Below is a table listing the versions in which each Mockoon Cloud feature was introduced in the desktop application:
