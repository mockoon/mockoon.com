# Discover Mockoon Cloud

---

[Mockoon Cloud](/cloud/) is a set of features that allows you to **deploy your mock APIs in the cloud**, **synchronize your data across your team**, and **collaborate on your mock API projects**.

Mockoon Cloud features are available in the [desktop](/download/) and [web](https://app.mockoon.com) applications and are part of the Mockoon Cloud paid plans. Read on to learn how to use it and the different features it offers.

## Features

- **[Web application](cloud-docs:web-application)**: Access your mock APIs and collaborate on them using the Mockoon Cloud web application, without installing the desktop application.
- **[API mock deployments](cloud-docs:api-mock-cloud-deployments)**: Deploy your mock APIs in the cloud and share them with your team, clients, or class.
- **[Data synchronization and team collaboration](cloud-docs:data-synchronization-team-collaboration)**: Synchronize your mock APIs in the cloud, share them with your team, and collaborate in real time.
- **[AI assistants](cloud-docs:templates-and-ai-assistant)**: Use our AI assistants to generate realistic mock data and HTTP endpoints.

## Getting started

To use Mockoon Cloud features, you need to **create a Mockoon Cloud account** and [**subscribe to a paid plan**](/cloud/). You can then **log in** to the desktop application and start using the features.

Follow our [getting started guide](/tutorials/getting-started-with-mockoon-cloud/) to learn how to setup your account and start using Mockoon Cloud.
