# About docs

---

This documentation covers Mockoon's most used features and options to help you create the best mock APIs. These topics apply to the desktop application and the CLI, which supports the same features.
We maintain a documentation for the four latest desktop versions. Head over to our [releases section](/releases/desktop/) for more details about the changes in each version.

If you find a mistake in the documentation, you can open an issue on the [website's repository](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon.com).

## CLI docs

You will find the [CLI documentation](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/tree/main/packages/cli) in its dedicated readme file on the repository. It covers the CLI's specific features, like the available flags or how to use the Docker file.

## Serverless docs

You will find the [serverless package documentation](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/tree/main/packages/serverless) in its dedicated readme file on the repository. It covers the package usage instructions and specific features.
