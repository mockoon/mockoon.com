Are you discovering Mockoon's GUI or forgot what this button is used for? These cheat sheets are for you!

## Main view

Below is Mockoon's **main view** where you set up your mock APIs, endpoints, responses, etc. It's the view where you will spend the most time. From this view, you can access the **request logging** and **environment settings** views (see below) by clicking on the icon in the upper right corner.

## Requests recording view

Below is the **request logging** view. This view is especially useful to debug the entering calls and how Mockoon responded to them. For each, you will find the usual information: path, headers, body, etc.
You can also see if the call has been caught or forwarded through the [proxy](docs:proxy-mode) (if enabled), and [automatically mock](docs:requests-logging) entering requests that were not caught.

## Environment settings view

Below is the environment settings view. Here you can set up global settings for each environment. [Enabling HTTPS](docs:https), [handling OPTIONS pre-flight requests automatically](docs:cors), enable the [proxy mode](docs:proxy-mode), etc.
