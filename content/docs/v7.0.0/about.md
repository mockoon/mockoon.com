# About the documentation

---

This documentation covers Mockoon's most used features and options to help you create the best mock APIs. These topics apply to the [desktop application](/download/), [CLI](/cli/), and [serverless package](/serverless/) which supports the same features.
We maintain a documentation for the five latest desktop versions. Head over to our [releases section](/releases/) for more details about the changes in each version.

If you find a mistake in the documentation, you can open an issue on the [website's repository](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon.com).

## Serverless documentation

You will find the [serverless package documentation](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/blob/main/packages/serverless/README.md) in its dedicated readme file on the repository. It covers the package usage instructions and specific features.
