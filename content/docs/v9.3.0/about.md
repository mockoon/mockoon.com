# About the documentation

---

This documentation covers Mockoon's most used features and options to help you create the best mock APIs. These topics apply to the [desktop application](/download/), [CLI](/cli/), and [serverless package](/serverless/) which supports the same features.

You will find a documentation for the most recent releases of Mockoon. Head over to our [releases section](/releases/) for more details about the changes in each version.

If you find a mistake in the documentation, you can open an issue on the [website's repository](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon.com).

## CLI-specific documentation (flags, etc.)

You will find the [CLI documentation](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/blob/main/packages/cli/README.md) in its dedicated readme file on the repository. It covers the CLI's specific features, like the available flags or how to use the Docker file.

## Serverless-specific documentation (options, etc.)

You will find the [serverless package documentation](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/blob/main/packages/serverless/README.md) in its dedicated readme file on the repository. It covers the package usage instructions and specific features.

## Web application

The [web application](cloud-docs:web-application) is a web version of the desktop application available for Mockoon Cloud customers. While based on the same codebase, it is not a direct replacement for the desktop application and does not support all the features. Please refer to the [web application documentation](cloud-docs:web-application#ui-differences) for more information about the differences.

## Versioning

Even if Mockoon is primarily a desktop application, we are following [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). All the applications and packages **share the same version number** for each release.

This allows you to migrate from one version to another without worrying about compatibility issues between the desktop application and the CLI or serverless package.

### Major versions

While the desktop application can easily **migrate from one version to another** (including major versions), this is not the case for the CLI or serverless package. When you are using one of your [data files](docs:mockoon-data-files/data-files-location) with the CLI or serverless package, or sharing it with your team, you need to make sure that the data file schema is compatible with the version you or your team is using.

Every time we introduce a **breaking change** in the data file schema (e.g. new feature) we release a **new major version**. We recommend that you always migrate simultaneously to the same major version for all the desktop applications and packages you are using.

> üìù Note to our Cloud users: the same recommendation applies when you are using our **Cloud features**. Please have a look at the [team collaboration](cloud-docs:data-synchronization-team-collaboration#major-versions-migrations) and [cloud deployments](cloud-docs:api-mock-cloud-deployments#major-versions-migrations) documentations for more information.

### Breaking changes

When building libraries, the definition of a **breaking change** is usually straightforward. However, when building desktop applications, it's harder to define what a breaking change is.

Also, as we have **multiple components** (desktop application, CLI, serverless package), we have to consider the impact of a change on all these components while avoiding a too-strict definition of a breaking change that would mandate a new major version for every release.

Our definition of a breaking change is a change impacting the¬†[**data schema**](docs:mockoon-data-files/data-files-location)¬†and creating a **compatibility issue** between the applications and packages.

Examples of **schema changes** that would require a **new major version**:

- Adding a new feature requiring a new field.
- Adding a new type in an enum field, like a new rule type.
- Removing a feature that requires removing a field from the schema.

The consequence of such a change is that the data file created with a recent version of the desktop application would not be compatible with an older version of the desktop application, CLI, serverless package, or a team Cloud workspace.

What we do **not consider a breaking change**, even if it might impact the user experience and require a migration effort:

- Changing the UI layout.
- Changing the behavior of a feature (e.g. adding templating support to a field).
- Changing the templating helpers' signatures or adding new ones.
