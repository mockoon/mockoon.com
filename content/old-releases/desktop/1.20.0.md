## Disabled rules

There is a new mode alongside randomized and sequential responses: disabled rules. It will always serve the default response and ignore the rules.

(Issue [#498](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/498))

## Invert the response rule operator

You can now invert the response rules' operators by clicking on the toggle button with an exclamation mark:

![route-response-rules-invert-operator{845x173}](/images/releases/desktop/1.20.0/invert-rule.png)

After enabling this option, you can read the operators like this: **not** a **regex match**, **not** **equals**, etc.

(Issue [#690](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/690))

## `multipart/form-data` support

Templating helpers (`body` and `bodyRaw`) and response rules are now compatible with `multipart/form-data`. Entering requests containing multipart data with the correct `Content-Type` will be automatically parsed. You can then retrieve any variable or use them in the rules like you would do with a JSON body.

(Issue [#347](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/347))

## Support for properties with dots

Properties with dots are now supported in the `body` and `bodyRaw ` templating helpers and in the rules. Escape the dots when you want to reach values contained in a property with dots:

```json
{
  "property.with.dot": "value"
}
```

(Issue [#338](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/338))

## Fixes

- We fixed a race conditions where settings were accessed before being loaded. (Issue [#751](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/751))

## Improvements

- The route responses menu now takes the full available width (Issue [#719](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/719))
- We enabled XML support for the `application/soap+xml` content type. (Issue [#757](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/757))

## Misc

We started working on a new internal release system that relies more on our own infrastructure rather than GitHub releases (Issue [#769](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/769)). This is a long-term plan that will allow us to offer more release channels in the future.
