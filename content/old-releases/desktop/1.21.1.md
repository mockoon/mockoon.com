## Version 1.21.0 Release changelog

## ⚠️ Breaking change

- `setVar` helper has been reworked and is not breaking anymore when used inside an `each`. The usage of variables is also uniformized and now requires an `@`. See the updated [documentation](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-variables-helpers/#setvar) for more information. (Issue [#793](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/793))

## New data buckets

We added a new feature called "Data buckets". It's a key-value store available in each environment. Each data bucket is persistent and generated when the server starts. Data buckets can be directly [linked to a route response](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/data-buckets/using-data-buckets/#referencing-in-a-route-response) or using one of the two new helpers: [`data`](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-helpers/#data) and [`dataRaw`](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-helpers/#dataraw).
Read the [documentation](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/data-buckets/overview/) to learn more.

This first step will make the development of CRUD and GraphQL routes easier.

(Issue [#783](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/783))

## Dialogs default directory

Until now, the save and open dialogs were pointing by default to Mockoon's **binary folder**. It could result in data loss as the folder could be wiped on some systems during an update. The dialogs now open to the application's **data folder** and save their current working directory as it should. (Issue [#756](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/756))

## Templating helpers

- We added a new [`parseInt`](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-helpers/#parseint) helper. (Issue [#766](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/766))
- We updated [Faker.js](https://fakerjs.dev/) from version 6.3.0 to version 7.6.0.

## Fixes

- The `date` helper is now compatible with other helpers like `queryParam`. (Issue [#781](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/pull/781))
- The `objectId` helper is now an alias for Faker.js' `mongodbObjectId` method. (Issue [#829](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/829))
- Serving a file with an unknown mime type now correctly revert to the environment Content-Type. (Issue [#785](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/785))
- Duplicating a route to an environment now correctly save the new route in the environment JSON file. (Issue [#790](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/790))
- **⚠️ Breaking change**: `setVar` helper has been reworked and is not breaking anymore when used inside an `each`. The usage of variables is also uniformized and now requires an `@`. See the updated [documentation](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-variables-helpers/#setvar) for more information. (Issue [#793](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/793))

## Improvements

- We improved the menus resizer visibility. (Issue [#729](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/729))
- `text/xml` content type is now suggested in the header autocomplete menu and is correctly enabling the editor's XML syntax highlighting. (Issue [#798](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/798))
