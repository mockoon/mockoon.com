## ⚠️ Breaking changes

- The [`faker` templating helper](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/fakerjs-helpers/) is no longer stringifying arrays and objects. It can now be used with other helpers like `each`. (Issue [#880](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/880))
- The `data` and `dataRaw` helpers do not return the full data bucket anymore when nothing was found at a specific path. (Issue [#918](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/918))

## Routes folders

You can now organize your routes into folders and sub-folders:

![routes organized in folders and sub-folders{718x467}](/images/releases/desktop/1.22.0/routes-nested-folder.png)

This new feature allows users to better organize their routes and make their APIs more readable and easier to navigate, with a clearer hierarchy. During the development, we also reworked how the drag and drop and the filtering are handled, which should result in an overall better experience. Head over to our [folders documentation](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/api-endpoints/folders/) to learn more about this feature.
(Issue [#97](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/97))

## Cloud functions and serverless environments

We published a new [@mockoon/serverless package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mockoon/serverless) to help you run your mocks in cloud functions and serverless environments (AWS Lambda, GCP/Firebase Functions, etc.).
Head over to the [dedicated documentation](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/tree/main/packages/serverless) to learn more.

(Issue [#861](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/861))

## Improvements

- The full helpers list have been added to the autocomplete menu in the body editor. (Issue [#289](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/289))
- A new [`dateFormat`](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-helpers/#dateFormat) helper has been added. (Issue [#873](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/873))
- The HTTP status message (`404 - Not Found`) is now visible in the logs tab. (Issue [#852](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/852))
- A new [`status`](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-response-helpers/#status) templating helper is available. It lets you customize the response status code inside a template. (Issue [#894](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/pull/894))

## Fixes

- The [`faker` templating helper](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/fakerjs-helpers/) is now compatible with some helpers like `queryParam`. (Issue [#887](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/pull/887))
- The `data` and `dataRaw` helpers do not return the full data bucket anymore when nothing was found at a specific path. (Issue [#918](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/918))
- Templating errors are now correctly reported in the response body when they occurs during the [generation of a data bucket](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/data-buckets/overview/). (Issue [#866](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/866))
