## CRUD routes

We are excited to release a new long-awaited feature: the CRUD endpoint.
Where Mockoon routes are independent and stateless, CRUD endpoints can generate multiple routes to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on [data buckets](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/data-buckets/overview/). Data buckets are generated when the server start, their state persisting between calls. It makes them the perfect tool to simulate small databases.

Head over to the [CRUD routes documentation](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/api-endpoints/crud-routes/) to learn everything you need to make the most of them.

## Default listening IP addresses

Mockoon desktop and CLI now listen by default to both IPv4 (0.0.0.0) and IPv6 (::) default addresses. You can also override the hostname in the desktop application in the environment settings tab:

(Issue [#930](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/930))

## Add support for OpenAPI's examples

Mockoon can now create responses from OpenAPI `examples` during import. Considering this partial OpenAPI YAML specification file:

```
/activities:
  get:
    summary: List of activities
    responses:
      '200':
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: array
              items:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Activity'
            examples:
              Sports:
                value:
                  - id: 1
                    name: Basketball
                  - id: 2
                    name: Volleyball
              Music:
                value:
                  - id: 3
                    name: Guitar
                  - id: 4
```

Mockoon will automatically create multiple responses from the schema and the examples:

(Issue [#967](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/pull/967))

## WebDAV HTTP methods

Mockoon now supports WebDAV's HTTP methods for distributed authoring as specified in the RFC2518 Section 8:

(Issue [#937](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/937))

## Auto-start environments

We added a new setting to auto-start the environments when the application launches:

![checkbox to enable environments auto-start{546x88}](/images/releases/desktop/1.23.0/environments-auto-start.png)

(Issue [#121](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/121))

## Improved logs interface

We improved the logs interface to clarify the purpose of the delete button:

(Issue [#686](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/686))

## Small improvements and fixes

- The Docker image now exposes port 3000 by default when you cannot specify a port to expose (e.g. GitLab CI). You can still override the default exposed port using `-p` at runtime or `ports` inside a docker-compose configuration file. (Issue [#932](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/932))
- Fixed data buckets request helpers not being detected when imbricated in other helpers. (Issue [#928](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/928))
- A missing `text/markdown` content type was added to the headers auto-completion.
