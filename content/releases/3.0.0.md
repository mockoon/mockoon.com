## Unified versioning

We are now using unified versioning across all our packages. This means that the desktop application, the CLI, and the serverless package will all be released with the same version number. This will make it easier to know which version of the CLI or the serverless package is compatible with the latest features of the desktop application.
In practical terms, these changes mean that the desktop application will now follow semver and will be released with the same minor or major version number alongside the CLI and serverless package. This starts today with the release of v3.0.0.

## ⚠️ Breaking changes

- Mockoon's desktop application is no longer compatible with Windows 7 and 8.
- We dropped support for Node.js v14. The CLI and the serverless package now require at least Node.js 16.
- The Docker image is now built using `node:18-alpine`.

## Desktop application

- **Breaking change**: We updated the application to the latest version of Electron. Thus, it is no longer compatible with Windows 7 and 8. (Issue [#977](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/977))
- The custom URL scheme (`mockoon://`) was temporarily deactivated on Linux due to a bug causing association of HTML files with Mockoon. (Issue [#997](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/997))
- We fixed a bug were the next route wasn't made active when the first one was deleted. (Issue [#1014](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1014))

## CLI

- **Breaking change**: The CLI's Docker image is now using `node:18-alpine`. (Issue [#959](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/959))
- **Breaking change**: We dropped support for Node.js v14. The CLI now requires Node.js 16 at least. (Issue [#959](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/959))
- A new flag `--disable-log-to-file` is available to disable the file logging. It is now the default for the Docker image. (Issue [#868](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/868))
- Our CLI's Docker image is now multi-architecture and compatible with Arm64. (Issue [#670](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/670))
- Curl was added to the Docker image to enable health checks. (Issue [#945](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/945))
- We migrated the Oclif dependency for the CLI to the latest versions. The message stating that "cli-ux" is deprecated is not present anymore. (Issue [#997](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/997))

## Serverless package

- **Breaking change**: We dropped support for Node.js v14. The package is now requiring Node.js 16 at least. (Issue [#959](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/959))

## Common changes

### New templating helpers

Multiple helpers were added:

- [`padStart`](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-helpers/#padstart) and [`padEnd`](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-helpers/#padend) mimicking the native JavaScript String methods. (Issue [#855](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/855))
- [`getVar`](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-variables-helpers/#getvar) to access variable created with `setVar` dynamically. (Issue [#885](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/885))

We also made the following improvements:

- [`dateFormat`](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-helpers/#dateformat) is now compatible with Date objects returned by helpers such as Faker's `date.recent`: `{{dateFormat (faker 'date.recent') 'yyyy-MM-dd'}}` (Issue [#1012](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1012))

### Chores

- Dropping Node.js 14 support allowed us to remove the `uuid` dependency across all the packages. (Issue [#1003](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1003))
