## Mockoon Cloud plan announcement

We are happy to announce that Mockoon Cloud plans are now available. The first feature available in this plan is the ability to [generate mock endpoints using our AI assistant](https://mockoon.com/ai-powered-api-mocking/) alongside access to dozens of [templates](https://mockoon.com/templates/). It is the perfect companion for quick prototyping and teaching API concepts!

The Cloud plan is available for solo developers and teams. The Enterprise tier also includes priority support and a welcome training.

Subscribing to the Cloud plan is also a good way to **support this open-source project** and contribute to its sustainability.

We will add more features to the Cloud plan in the future. You can subscribe to our newsletter on the Cloud plan page to be notified when they are available.

## Desktop application

### New recording mode in the logs view

A new recording mode is available in the logs view. It allows you to automatically create endpoints from the entering requests and proxied responses ([documentation](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/logging-and-recording/auto-mocking-and-recording/)).

(Issue [#722](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/722))

### Status code shown in logs entries

The status code is now shown in the logs entries:

(Issue [#1031](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1031))

### Zoom

You can now zoom in and out using the `Ctrl + +` and `Ctrl + -` shortcuts. The zoom can also be reset using `Ctrl 0`.

### Misc

- The default data folder for Snap installations is now `~/snap/mockoon/common/.mockoon` instead of the current Snap version folder. This will prevent losing data during application updates. (Issue [#1026](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1026))

## CLI

- `tzdata` was added to the Docker image to enable timezone configuration. (Issue [#865](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/865))

## Serverless package

- The package and its [documentation](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/blob/main/packages/serverless/README.md) was updated to help you deploy your mock API to Netlify's serverless functions. (Issue [#1060](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/pull/1060))
