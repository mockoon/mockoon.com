## New response fallback mode

A new response mode has been added. It allows you to fallback to the next route and ultimately the proxied server when no response rules match instead of serving the default response. Visit the [documentation](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/route-responses/multiple-responses/#fallback-mode) to learn more. (Issues [#363](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/363))

## Dynamic rules with templating

The templating helpers are now supported in the rule values letting you create dynamic rules. (Issue [#988](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/988))

## Changes to templating helpers

- Two new templating helpers have been added to allow [array filtering](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-helpers/#filter) and [object creation](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-helpers/#object). (Issues [#1103](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1103))

- Properties with dots are now supported in the `queryParam` and `queryParamRaw` templating helpers. Escape the dots when you want to reach values contained in a property with dots. See the examples in our [documentation](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-request-helpers/#queryparam). (Issue [#1115](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1115))

- The [`eq` templating helper](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-helpers/#eq) is now compatible with strings. (Issue [#1114](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1114))

## Other changes

- Templating helpers in Handlebars files with `.hbs` or `.handlebars` are now correctly parsed. (Issue [#1120](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1120))
