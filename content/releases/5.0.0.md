## ⚠️ Breaking changes

We introduced two breaking changes in this major release:

- We dropped support for Node.js v16. The CLI and the serverless package now require at least Node.js 18.
- Support was dropped for [legacy data files](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/mockoon-data-files/data-storage-location/#old-system-pre-v1-16-0) in both Desktop and CLI. If you are updating from v1.15.0, please first update to any version between v1.16.0 and v4.1.0, then to v5.0.0.

## JSONPath support

Mockoon now supports [JSONPath](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonpath-plus) alongside [object-path](https://www.npmjs.com/package/object-path) everywhere a path to an object property can be provided:

- in templating helpers like [`data`](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-helpers/#data), [`dataRaw`](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-helpers/#dataRaw), [`body`](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-request-helpers/#body), [`bodyRaw`](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-request-helpers/#bodyRaw), [`queryParam`](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-request-helpers/#queryparam) and [`queryParamRaw`](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-request-helpers/#queryparamraw).
- in the [response rules path](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/route-responses/dynamic-rules/#2-property-name-or-path).

We are using the [JSONPath Plus](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonpath-plus) library. Please refer to its documentation to learn more about the syntax. The simpler [object-path](https://www.npmjs.com/package/object-path) syntax is still supported.

(Issue [#995](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/995))

## Routes targeting all HTTP methods

It is now possible to create routes that will match any HTTP method. You can now select "All methods" in the routes method dropdown:

## Global routes with rules

Thanks to the [response fallback mode](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/route-responses/multiple-responses/#fallback-mode) introduced in v4.1.0, it was already possible to create wildcard routes containing "global" rules, like validating the presence of an `Authorization` header, or verifying that the request body contains a specific property.
The only missing piece was the ability to create a global route that would match any HTTP method, which is now possible with the new feature above.

Head over to our new ["Global routes with rules"](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/route-responses/global-routes-with-rules/) documentation section to learn how to create reusable responses and rules and apply them to all your routes.

We also updated the desktop application's demo environment to showcase this new feature.

(Issue [#221](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/221))

## Desktop application

- **Breaking change**: Support was dropped for [legacy data files](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/mockoon-data-files/data-storage-location/#old-system-pre-v1-16-0) (pre v1.16.0). The desktop application will no longer automatically migrate your environments from the old system. If you are updating from v1.15.0, please first update to any version between v1.16.0 and v4.1.0, then to v5.0.0. (Issue [#1138](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1138))

- We added a link in the footer update notification to let you easily check the new version's changelog (will be visible for updates >v5.0.0):

## CLI

- **Breaking change**: We dropped support for Node.js v16. The CLI now requires Node.js 18 at least. (Issue [#1119](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1119))
- **Breaking change**: Support was dropped for opening [legacy data files](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/mockoon-data-files/data-storage-location/#old-system-pre-v1-16-0) (pre v1.16.0). (Issue [#1138](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1138))
- The Docker image is now tagged with its major version. Starting with version 5, all v5.x.x will be tagged `5` and so on. (Issue [#1132](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1132))

## Serverless package

- **Breaking change**: We dropped support for Node.js v16. The package is now requiring Node.js 18 at least. (Issue [#1119](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1119))

## Chores

- We updated most of the application dependencies to their latest version in order to fix recent security vulnerabilities.
