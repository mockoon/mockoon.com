## CRUD filtering and searching

This new feature adds **search and filter** options to the main GET endpoint of a CRUD route, using query parameters. Many operators are available to filter your data like `_eq`,`_gt`,`_lte`, or `_start`. They can filter on any property of the data, including nested properties using the dot notation:

`/users?name_eq=John&age_gt=18&address.city_start=New`

You can also use the `search` parameter to search for a string in all properties of the data:

`/users?search=john`

Read more about this feature in the [documentation](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/api-endpoints/crud-routes/#filtering-sorting-and-pagination-on-the-main-get-route).

(Issue [#1047](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1047))

## Global variables

Mockoon now supports **global variables** that can be set and accessed using the [`setGlobalVar`](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-variables-helpers/#setglobalvar) and [`getGlobalVar`](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-variables-helpers/#getglobalvar) helpers at runtime.

```handlebars
{{setGlobalVar 'myVar' 'myValue'}}
{{getGlobalVar 'myVar'}}
```

These variables can be used anywhere templating is supported, like the response body or headers. Their values are reset when the environment is stopped or restarted.

Read more about this feature in the [documentation](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/variables/global-variables/).

## OpenAPI import improvements

- The OpenAPI v3 specification `server.url` is now correctly parsed when it only contains a path (no protocol or domain). (Issue [#1221](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1221))
- The CLI is now correctly reporting the OpenAPI import errors alongside Mockoon's format parser errors. (Issue [#1229](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1229))
- Files with `.yml` extensions are now selectable in the OpenAPI import dialog. (Issue [#1229](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1229))

## CLI and Serverless new Faker.js options

New flags were added to the CLI, and new options to the Serverless package, to allow setting the Faker.js locale and seed.

For the CLI, use the `--faker-locale` and `--faker-seed` flags. More information in the [CLI's documentation](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/blob/main/packages/cli/README.md#fakerjs-options).

For the Serverless package, use the `fakerOptions.locale` and `fakerOptions.seed` options:

```javascript
const mockoonServerless = new mockoon.MockoonServerless(mockEnv, {
  fakerOptions: {
    locale: 'en_GB',
    seed: 1234
  }
});
```

More information in the [Serverless package's documentation](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/blob/main/packages/serverless/README.md#fakerjs-options)

(Issue [#669](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/669))

## Desktop application

- Fix the data bucket name not being displayed on a CRUD route view when creating from the template modal. (Issue [#1234](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1234))
- Fix the Faker.js locale not being applied from the settings on startup. (Issue [#1222](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1222))
- Fix callbacks not being removed from the route response's callbacks view when deleted, in the case multiple responses were present. (Issue [#1215](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1215))
