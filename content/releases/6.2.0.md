## Support for global variables in response rules

Mockoon now **supports global variables in the response rules**. This allows you to set a global variable during one call and use it in a rule to change the returned response.

Read more about this feature in the [documentation](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/route-responses/dynamic-rules/#1-target).

(Issue [#1262](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1262))

## Templating helpers changes

- Fix the `someOf` helper not correctly stringifying empty arrays and returning `[""]` instead of `[]`. (Issue [#1289](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1289))
- Some Faker.js helpers like `string.alpha` can receive a complex object (more than one level deep) as a parameter. A new syntax was introduced to make their usage easier. E.g.:
  `{{faker 'string.alpha' '{ length: 5, casing: "upper", exclude: ["A"] }' }}`. (Issue [#1218](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1218))
- We added a third parameter to provide a default value to the [`getGlobalVar` helper](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-variables-helpers/#getglobalvar). (Issue [#1263](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1263))
- A new [`jsonParse` helper](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-helpers/#jsonparse) was added to parse a stringified JSON. (Issue [#1227](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1227))

## OpenAPI import improvements

- OpenAPI endpoint's **header values** are now correctly imported from `schemas` and `examples`. (Issue [#1244](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1244))
- `example` and `examples` properties are now correctly used when building a schema present in a `allOf`, `anyOf` or `oneOf`. (Issue [#948](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/948))

## Support for vendor specific JSON content types

Mockoon now **supports vendor specific JSON content types** like `application/vnd.something+json`. Request bodies with these content types will be correctly **parsed** and **available in the templating helpers and rules**. (Issue [#1269](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1269))

## Desktop application

### New welcome screen and tour

We updated the **welcome screen** and **added a tour** to help new users discover Mockoon's features. You can access the new tour at any time using the "Help" menu.

The welcome screen, before and after:

(Issue [#1278](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/pull/1278))

### Support for Linux ARM64 architecture

We now provide binaries (deb and AppImage) for the **Linux ARM64 architecture**. Links to these binaries are available on the [download page](https://mockoon.com/download/). Due to the limited access we have to this architecture, we can't provide a snap package at the moment. We also thank you to report any issue you may encounter with these binaries.

(Issues [#507](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/507) and [#1299](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/pull/1299))

### MacOS new command and updated quit behavior

We reworked the macOS `cmd + W` and `cmd + Q` commands. The application will now correctly quit when pressing `cmd + Q` or using the menu's "Quit" option. We also introduced a new `cmd + W` command and application menu entry to close the current window. It should align Mockoon's behavior with other Mac applications.

(Issue [#1097](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1097))

### Misc

- The **"proxied" icon is now correctly displayed** in the logs when forwarded requests result from the triggering of the [fallback mode](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/route-responses/multiple-responses/#fallback-mode). (Issue [#1267](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1267))
- The **application logo was updated** for the new "sticker" design to be more visible when the operating system dark mode is enabled. (Issue [#1266](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1266))
- We fixed the "Environment needs restart" orange icon disappearing after updating a property that doesn't require a restart. (Issue [#1254](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/pull/1254))
- An issue was fixed causing a folder name to show another folder's name after successive editing. (Issue [#1279](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1279))

## CLI

- We fixed a bug where the CLI could crash when used in a project importing `chalk` ESM only version (> version 5). (Issue [#1276](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1276))

## Fixes

- The callbacks are now correctly executed when the body type is set to "file". (Issue [#1285](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1285))

## Chores

- Fixed a test breaking after the switch to the new year! It shouldn't happen anymore ðŸ™‚. (Issue [#1248](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1248))
- Removed the search filter directive in the desktop application due to an incompatibility with the `trackBy` function and replaced with observables. (Issue [#1264](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/pull/1264))
- We migrated from Firebase Remote Config to our API to allow for more flexibility in the future. (Issue [#1290](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/pull/1290))
