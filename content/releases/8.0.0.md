## Data synchronization and team collaboration

We are really excited to announce the availability of the **data synchronization and real-time collaboration features** in the Mockoon desktop application as part of our Mockoon Pro offer. This feature allows you to synchronize your environments data across multiple devices if you are a solo developer or share it with your team members and collaborate in real time.

Nothing changed in the application interface except for the new "Cloud" section in the main menu. This is where you can create cloud environments and start collaborating. For the rest, the application behaves the same way as before, with your local environments staying local.

We have written a [dedicated documentation page](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/mockoon-cloud/data-synchronization-team-collaboration/) that gathers most of the information you need about this feature.

We spent a lot of time developing this feature and are very proud of the result. We hope you will enjoy using it as much as we enjoyed developing it. We are looking forward to your feedback and suggestions to make it even better!

## Pre-generated templates are now free

We decided to make the pre-generated templates available for free to all users. It means you can now use the pre-generated templates without subscribing to the Mockoon Pro offer.

## Support for data buckets in response rules

Mockoon now **supports data buckets targets in the response rules**. This allows you to serve specific responses based on a data bucket content.

To access the data bucket content, you can use the object-path or JSONPath syntaxes: `$.dataBucketNameOrId.path.to.value`. Read more about this feature in the [documentation](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/route-responses/dynamic-rules/#1-target).

## API admin endpoint and purging the state

Each running mock server now exposes an **admin API** that allows you to manage your environment.

The first feature we added to this API is the ability to **purge the state of a running mock server**. Calling `PURGE /mockoon-admin/state` or `POST /mockoon-admin/state/purge` on your running API will reset the state of the data buckets and reset the requests counter.

This can be used to automate the management of your mock server, especially in a remote environment, without having to restart the application.

Read more about this feature in the [documentation](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/admin-api/overview/).

## New external files menu

We added a new menu next to the external file path input that allows you to quickly **view the file in the explorer/finder** or **open it in your default editor**:

## Fixes

- We moved the execution of the callbacks after the response template generation to allow the callback's own templates to access the global variables. (Issue [#1300](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1300))
- The `{{ipv4}}` helper is now correctly returning only IPv4 addresses instead of a mix of IPv4 and IPv6. (Issue [#1332](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1332))

## Chores

We updated the libraries and applications dependencies to their latest versions to fix some reported vulnerabilities.
