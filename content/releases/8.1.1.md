- The same environment file could be opened multiple times. (Issue [#1381](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1381))

## Logs view improvements

For this release, the desktop application's **Logs view** has been improved. It now includes a search bar to filter logs by URL, method, status code, query, or timestamp:

![logs view with search bar{844x404}](/images/releases/8.1.0/filter-logs-by-url.png)

(Issue [#1109](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1109))

We also added proper **code editors** for the **request and response bodies** in the logs view. They will now display the content with proper formatting and syntax highlighting, and show eventual errors for the JSON format. As a side effect, the bodies are now searchable:

![logs view with code editors{1218x775}](/images/releases/8.1.0/code-editors-logs-view.png)

(Issues [#368](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/368) and [#137](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/137))

Last modification, the **"Last log" link** displayed under the response body now shows when the request or response JSON was malformed:

## Admin API

Since the introduction of the admin API in the [previous release](https://mockoon.com/releases/8.0.0/), we added multiple new features:

- The [admin API can now be **deactivated**](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/admin-api/overview/#disable-the-admin-api) when running your mock with the CLI or the serverless library. (Issue [#1371](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1371))
- You can now [reset and update the global variables](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/admin-api/global-variables/) using the `/mockoon-admin/global-vars` endpoint. (Issue [#1354](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1354))
- The environment variables can be updated using the `/mockoon-admin/env-vars` endpoint. (Issue [#1372](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1372))
- The [transaction logs](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/admin-api/transaction-logs/) of a running mock server can be fetched using the `/mockoon-admin/logs` endpoint. (Issue [#632](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/632))
- The [data buckets can be regenerated](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/admin-api/data-buckets/) without having to reset the full server state using the `/mockoon-admin/data-buckets` endpoint. (Issue [#1373](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1373))

Head to the [documentation](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/admin-api/overview/) to learn more about the admin API.

## New CLI flags and serverless options

We added **new flags** to the CLI to allow you to:

- `--disable-admin-api` to deactivate the admin API. (Issue [#1371](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1371))
- `--disable-tls` to override the TLS settings and disable it when running in your CI server. (Issue [#668](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/668))
- `--max-transaction-logs` to set the number of logs kept in memory for retrieval via the admin API. (Issue [#632](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/632))

[Similar options](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/tree/main/packages/serverless#options) have been added to the serverless library.

## TLS and environment variables

**Templating** is now supported in the **TLS configuration**, allowing you to use environment variables in the certificate paths and password fields.

(Issue [#1371](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1371))

## Improvements

You can now open **multiple environments** at once in the desktop application:

![open file dialog showing multiple files being selected{1083x689}](/images/releases/8.1.0/open-multiple-environments.png)
(Issue [#1187](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1187))

## Fixes

- The PATCH method wasn't working in the callbacks. This is now fixed. (Issue [#1364](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1364))
- Fixed a bug were the application could reconnect to the sync server with a previous token after switching to a different account. (Issue [#1369](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1369))

## Chores

We updated the libraries and applications dependencies to their latest versions to fix some reported vulnerabilities.
