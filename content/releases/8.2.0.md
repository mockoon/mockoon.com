## Desktop UI improvements and polishings

During this release, we decided to **remove the right-click context menus** from various parts of the application. We believe they are not ideal for accessibility and feature discoverability. Also, the options that were behind these menus were often not known by users. We replaced them with buttons in the UI and regular dropdowns

We also **revamped all the application's lists** to make them more consistent and display more information at a glance, in a more consistent way. We hope you will like these changes!

The log entries action was moved to a new dropdown menu:

Finally, the unique ID in the data bucket view is now clickable and will copy the ID to the clipboard:

As always, with UX and design changes, there is no easy choice, and it may require a bit of adaptation. We are here to help if you have any questions or feedback.

## New endpoint generation with the AI assistant (Cloud)

We are excited to introduce a new feature in Mockoon Cloud: the **HTTP endpoint AI assistant**. This assistant will help you generate endpoints based on a prompt. It will save you time and help you to create your API mocks faster.

The assistant will generate a coherent HTTP endpoint including, **path**, **method**, **body**, and **documentation** based on the prompt you provide:

We also simplified the AI assistant options, now **defaulting to JSON**. Only the templating option is now available, and the **differentiation between a single object or array is inferred from the prompt**.

## Folder's child routes toggling

A new entry to the folder's dropdown menu allows you to **toggle** (enable/disable) **all the routes** in a folder at once:

![view of the new folder toggle menu entry{525x257}](/images/releases/8.2.0/folder-toggle.png)

As a counterpart, you can toggle all the routes in a folder at runtime using the [CLI's `--disable-routes` flag](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/tree/main/packages/cli#disabling-routes) followed by the folder name or the [`disabledRoutes` option of the serverless package](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/tree/main/packages/serverless#disabling-routes).

## Previously selected environment

The **selected environment** is now **saved** by the desktop application and will be **restored** when you restart Mockoon. It should help you quickly resume your work where you left off.

(Issue [#1396](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1396))

## Improvement to routes filtering

The routes can now be **filtered by type**, either "http" or "crud":

## Default CORS headers

The **CORS headers** are now **added by default** to all new environments. This should help you to avoid CORS issues when testing your APIs.

(Issue [#1392](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1392))

## Fixes

- Mockoon's server is now able to detect if the **request body** was **already parsed** and act accordingly. Thus, requests containing a body are now correctly working with **Firebase or Google Cloud Functions** when using Mockoon's serverless package.
