## Cloud deployments are now available in Mockoon Cloud

We are excited to announce that Mockoon Cloud now supports **cloud deployments** of your mock APIs. This feature is available in the desktop application and is part of the Mockoon Cloud paid plans. It allows you to deploy your mock APIs to our cloud and share them with your team, clients, or class.

You can **deploy your mock APIs** directly from the desktop application, and set the instance **visibility to public or private**. Public instances are accessible to anyone with the URL, while private instances require an API key to access:

You can also **manage your cloud deployments** from the desktop application. This includes re-deploying instance and change their visibility, or deleting instances:

We have many improvements and features planned for cloud deployments: environment variables support, custom domains, etc. So, stay tuned for more updates!

## Templating helpers

- Two new [`sort`](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-helpers/#sort) and [`sortBy`](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-helpers/#sortby) helpers are now available. They let you sort arrays of primitives or objects, respectively. (Issue [#1270](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1270))

## Improvements

- New data buckets now contain an empty array by default `[]`. This will help avoid issues when setting up a CRUD route with an empty data bucket (e.g. not being able to POST to insert items).
- The desktop application column resizing was improved. It's now showed faster and behave more smoothly. (Issue [#1405](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1405))

## Fixes

- A null pointer was fixed preventing the serverless package to work with Firebase Functions. (Issue [#1413](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1413))

### Thank you

A big thank you to the following people who helped to make Mockoon better:

- [@ajatkj](https://github.com/ajatkj): new array `sort` and `sortBy` helpers. (Issue [#1270](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1270))
