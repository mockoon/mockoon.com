## Templating support in rules property/path

**Templating helpers** are now available in the **response rules property or path field**. You can dynamically target a specific body property, header name, etc. using templating helpers:

[Response rules documentation](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/route-responses/dynamic-rules/#2-property-name-or-path)

(Issue [#1443](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1443))

## New JWT templating helpers

Two new templating helpers are now available to help you **decode JWT tokens** in your responses: `jwtPayload` and `jwtHeader`. They let you access the **payload** and **header** objects respectively. These helpers are compatible with other templating helpers like `header`. They will also automatically ignore the `Bearer ` prefix if present in the provided string, to make it easier to use them with an `Authorization` header.

```handlebars
{{jwtPayload 'abcd...' 'sub'}}
{{jwtHeader 'abcd...' 'alg'}}

{{jwtPayload (header 'Authorization') 'sub'}}
{{jwtHeader (header 'Authorization') 'alg'}}
```

Check the [helpers documentation](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/jwt-helpers/) for more information.

(Issue [#774](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/774))

## Dot notation support in the CRUD route's key

CRUD route key now supports **dot notation**. It allows you to perform CRUD operations (e.g. get by id, update by id, etc.) based on nested properties:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": 1
  }
}
```

(Issue [#1433](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1433))

## Random latencies

You can now **randomize the latency** of your route responses and environments. This feature is useful to simulate network latency variations and test your application's behavior under different network conditions.
It will randomize the latency of the response **between 0 and the value you set** in the environment or route parameters.

The option can be found in the application settings:

![Random latency settings{801x908}](/images/releases/8.4.0/random-latency-settings.png)

Options are also available in the [CLI](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/tree/main/packages/cli), in the form of a flag `--enable-random-latency`, and in the [serverless package](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/tree/main/packages/serverless), in the form of a new `enableRandomLatency` option:

```javascript
const mockoonServerless = new mockoon.MockoonServerless(mockEnv, {
  enableRandomLatency: true
});
```

## Logs timestamp improvement

In the logs tab, the logs timestamps are now displayed in a human-readable format like `7 hours ago` instead of `2024-01-01 08:00:00.123`.

(Issue [#1430](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1430))

## Mockoon Cloud desktop application improvements

- Custom scheme based authentication in the desktop application was replaced by a callback-based flow. (Issue [#1463](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1463))
- Fixed account downgrading not updating the running instances list. (Issue [#1461](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1461))
- Automatically refresh the instances list when opening the instances management dialog: (Issue [#1478](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1478))

## Fixes

- Last opened environment is now correctly saved after opening. (Issue [#1404](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1404))
- Fixed a null pointer when the last saved environment was deleted. (Issue [#1459](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1459))

## Chores

We updated the libraries and applications dependencies to their latest versions to fix some reported vulnerabilities.
