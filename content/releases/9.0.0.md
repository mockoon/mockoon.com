## ⚠️ Breaking changes

- Many new features were added (new rule types, new WebSocket routes, etc.) which resulted in **modifications of the [data files](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/mockoon-data-files/data-files-location/) schema**. If you are using your data files with the CLI or serverless package, or if you are sharing your setup with your team, we recommend you migrate every application to the new version at the same time to avoid any compatibility issues.

  _Note for teams using our Cloud_: We recommend that all team members update their application to the new version at the same time to ensure a smooth transition ([more information](https://mockoon.com/cloud/docs/data-synchronization-team-collaboration/#major-versions-migrations)). API deployed in our Cloud instances will continue running following the old schema (v8) until they are redeployed ([more information](https://mockoon.com/cloud/docs/api-mock-cloud-deployments/#major-versions-migrations)).

- We **updated the libraries and application dependencies** to their latest versions.
  - The most notable change is the **migration to Faker.js version 9**, which includes numerous function removals and some modifications to signatures and parameters. However, this should have minimal impact on your templates, as most functions were already deprecated in version 8 and have been automatically migrated to the new syntax (see Faker.js v9 [migration guide](https://fakerjs.dev/guide/upgrading.html)).
  - Another potential breaking change is the **fix of a JSONPath RCE vulnerability**. If you were using JSONPath in your templates, some advanced filters might not work as expected anymore. We whitelisted the most common and safe filters, like `$[?(@.status==='enabled' && @.id===1)]`. If you encounter any issues, please let us know.

## WebSocket support

We are excited to announce that Mockoon now supports **WebSockets**. You can create multiple WebSocket routes on different paths in each API and define the messages that will be sent using templating and rules:

![Add a new websocket route{1484x176}](/images/releases/9.0.0/set-ws-route-path.png)

The WebSocket feature also supports broadcasting that allows you to send a message to the connected clients at a specified interval:

![toggle the broadcasting mode{884x237}](/images/releases/9.0.0/toggle-ws-broadcast-streaming.png)

Websockets support most of Mockoon's existing features: route parameters, cookies, templating helpers, rules, etc. Head over to the [WebSockets documentation](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/api-endpoints/websockets/) to learn more about this feature.

(Issues [#83](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/83) and [#1495](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1495))

## New rules and operators

Mutiple improvements have been made to the templating rules system:

- We added a new [**"custom templating"** rule type](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/route-responses/dynamic-rules/#1-target) that allows you to use any templating as a source for your rules. (Issue [#1545](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1545))
  ![new custom templating rule type shown in dropdown menu{909x360}](/images/releases/9.0.0/new-custom-templating-rule-type.png)
- We added two new [**"request method"** and **"request path"** rule types](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/route-responses/dynamic-rules/#1-target) to check the incoming request's method and path. It will be particularly useful for routes declared with **wildcards** or on **all methods**, or to override some **CRUD routes operation** responses. (Issues [#1467](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1467) and [#1468](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1468))
  ![new request method and path rule types shown in dropdown menu{914x359}](/images/releases/9.0.0/new-request-method-path-rule-types.png)
- A new [**"array includes"** operator](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/route-responses/dynamic-rules/#4-comparison-operator) was added to check if a source array includes a value without relying on a regex. (Issue [#1444](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1444))
  ![new array includes rule operator shown in dropdown menu{909x276}](/images/releases/9.0.0/new-array-includes-rule-operator.png)
- A new [**"valid JSON schema"** operator](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/route-responses/dynamic-rules/#json-schemas) was added to check if a source is valid against a JSON schema stored in a data bucket. (Issue [#1452](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1452))
  ![new valid JSON schema rule operator shown in dropdown menu{910x273}](/images/releases/9.0.0/new-valid-json-schema-rule-operator.png)

## Better team collaboration presence indicators (Cloud)

The presence indicator for the real-time collaboration feature has been improved to show the active team members but also the current environment they are working on:

![team collaboration presence indicator showing multiple user working{668x157}](/images/releases/9.0.0/new-cloud-team-collaboration-presence-indicator.png)

(Issue [#1512](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1512))

## File upload metadata

We added support for **storing the uploaded file's metadata** (`filename`, `mimetype`, `size`) for multipart form data requests. While Mockoon is still not storing any uploaded files, this change will make simulating a file server easier. Combine with this [technique](https://mockoon.com/tutorials/create-endpoint-serving-static-file/) it becomes possible to simulate an upload and then serve the file back.

Head over to the [body helper documentation](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-request-helpers/#body) to learn more about this feature.

(Issue [#1445](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1445))

## CRUD ids auto-increment

Until now, CRUD routes' ids were UUIDs generated during object creations (`POST /resources`) if none was provided. CRUD routes now **supports auto-incremented ids**. If the data bucket array contain at least one object with a numeric `id` (or a custom property), the CRUD route will automatically increment the id of the new objects created.

[Documentation](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/api-endpoints/crud-routes/#autogenerated-ids-and-numeric-ids)

(Issue [#1542](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1542))

## Templating helpers

- We added a new [`setData` helper](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-helpers/#setdata) that allows you to manipulate your data buckets from anywhere. You can set, push, increment, decrement, invert. This will allow for more complex templating scenarios: authentication, feature flags, etc. (Issue [#1098](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1098))
- We added a new [`isValidDate` helper](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-helpers/#isvaliddate). (Issue [#1510](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1510))
- We added a new [`uuid` helper](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-helpers/#uuid) alias of `{{faker 'string.uuid'}}`. (Issue [#1533](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1533))
- The [`filter` helper](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-helpers/#filter) is now compatible with **nested objects**. (Issue [#1123](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1123))
- The [`filter`](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-helpers/#filter), [`eq`](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-helpers/#eq) and [`stringify`](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-helpers/#stringify) helpers are now compatible with SafeStrings and can therefore accept content from any helper including the ones sanitized by Handlebars. (Issues [#1489](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1489) and [#1529](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1529))

## Admin API new endpoints

Multiple new endpoints have been added to the admin API:

- **`GET /mockoon-admin/env-vars/:key`** to get the value of an environment variable ([documentation](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/admin-api/environment-variables/#get-an-environment-variable-value)).
- **`GET /mockoon-admin/global-vars/:key`** to get the value of a global variable ([documentation](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/admin-api/global-variables/#get-a-global-variable-value)).
- **`GET /mockoon-admin/data-buckets/:key`** to get the current value of a data bucket ([documentation](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/admin-api/data-buckets/#get-a-data-bucket-value)).

(Issue [#1557](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1557))

## Small UI improvement

The **number of responses** is now displayed next to the currently selected response:

![number of responses displayed next to the selected response in a badge{826x80}](/images/releases/9.0.0/number-of-responses-badge.png)

(Issue [#1528](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1528))

## Fixes

- We sanitized the helpers supporting a JSONPath to prevent RCE vulnerabilities. (Issue [#1551](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1551))
- Custom ids were not kept in CRUD routes when updating by id (`PUT /resources/:id`), this is now fixed. (Issue [#1548](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1548))
- We fixed an issue where deactivated inputs in the rules interface were not staying deactivated after navigating to another view. (Issue [#1517](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1517))
- When navigating from a CRUD route secondary response to the primary response, while being on a tab not available on the primary response, the UI stayed on the tab. This is now fixed. (Issue [#1552](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1552))

## Chores

- We renewed the Windows Code Signing certificate and migrated to Azure Trusted Signing. (Issue [#1514](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1514))
- We renewed the Apple Code Signing certificates. (Issue [#1513](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1513))
- [⚠️ Potential breaking change for your templates] We updated the libraries and applications dependencies to their latest versions to fix some reported vulnerabilities (notably the JSONPath CVE). As a result, we also migrated to Faker.js version 9 (see Faker.js v9 [migration guide](https://fakerjs.dev/guide/upgrading.html)).
