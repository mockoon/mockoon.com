## Improved data buckets state reporting

Because it can be difficult to know if your data buckets are generating valid JSON data, we added a new indicator in the UI to show you if they were **generated** and if the result was **valid JSON**:

![data bucket state indicator{1261x675}](/images/releases/9.1.0/data-bucket-state-indicator.png)

You can also click on the indicator to see the generated data in an editor and the validation error, if any (read-only):

(Issue [#1581](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1581))

## Cloud deployments

We added two new options to configure your mock deployments in the cloud: you can now **customize the subdomain** of your cloud deployment (e.g. `my-subdomain.{serverId}.mockoon.app`) and **disable the admin API** for your mock.

(Issues [#1572](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1572) and [#1614](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1614))

## New `--proxy` CLI flag and disabled routes wildcard support

We added a **new `--proxy` flag** to the CLI to allow you to override the proxy setting of your mock. This flag can either be set to **'enabled'** or **'disabled'**. This is useful when you want to start a mock with a different proxy setting than the one saved in the configuration file.

`mockoon-cli start -d ./mock.json --proxy enabled`

We also update the disabled routes flag and Serverless options behavior. You can now disable all routes at runtime by using a wildcard:

**With the CLI**:

`mockoon-cli start -d ./mock.json --disable-routes=*`

**With the Serverless package**:

```javascript
const mockoonServerless = new mockoon.MockoonServerless(mockEnv, {
  disabledRoutes: ['*']
});
```

(Issue [#1024](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1024))

## Improved request's path rule

The **request's path rule** will now compare the value against both the **original** and **actual** **paths**, for example, `/users/:id` and `/users/123`. It is now easier to override CRUD route operations.

![rule targeting the request path{1274x157}](/images/releases/9.1.0/rule-targeting-request-path.png)

(Issue [#1605](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1605))

## JSON Schema formats support and bug fixes

We added support for **JSON Schema formats**. You can now use the `format` keyword in your JSON Schema to validate your request bodies.

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "email": {
      "type": "string",
      "format": "email"
    }
  }
}
```

(Issue [#1594](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1594))

We also fixed a bug that prevented JSON schema from being compared against the root-level request body. ⚠️ This change may break some rules create without a path.
(Issue [#1595](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1595))

We published a new tutorial on how to use JSON Schema formats in Mockoon. [Check it out](https://mockoon.com/tutorials/validate-requests-payload-json-schema/).

## Templating helpers object merging

We added a new **[`objectMerge` templating helper](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-helpers/#objectmerge)** to merge two or more objects. We also added a new `merge` operator to the [`setData` helper](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-helpers/#setdata) and made [`concat`](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-helpers/#concat) compatible with arrays.

These changes should make object manipulation and merging easier in your templates.

(Issue [#1620](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1620))

## Fixes

- You can now target properties with dots in the file path input (e.g., `./folder/{{queryParam 'file\.name'}}.json`). (Issue [#1623](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1623))
- The `zipcode` templating helper was detected as a request helper and was delaying data bucket initialization. This is now fixed. (Issue [#1589](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1589))
- Brackets used for priority are now supported in JSONPath expressions: `$[?(@.status==='enabled' && (@.id===1 || @.id===2))]`. (Issue [#1583](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1583))
- Copying a route full path from the drop down-menu now uses the correct protocol for WebSocket routes. (Issue [#1579](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1579))
- The WebSocket server now correctly answers with a 404 when requesting a connection to a non-existent WebSocket endpoint. (Issue [#1612](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1612))
- Multipart/form-data parsing now supports multiple files and fields with the same name (not using the array/bracket notation). (Issue [#1613](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1613))

## Improvements

- Thanks to the update to the latest version of Faker.js, you can now generate JSON web tokens in your templates: `{{faker 'internet.jwt'}}`. (Issue [#740](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/740))

## Chores

- We updated the libraries and applications dependencies to their latest versions. As a result, we updated Faker.js to v9.3.0 which includes new functions (`jwt`, etc.) (see Faker.js [release notes](https://github.com/faker-js/faker/releases)).
