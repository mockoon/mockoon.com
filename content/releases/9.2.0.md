## Admin API always enabled on cloud deployments

In this release, we've made the **[admin API](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/admin-api/overview/) always enabled for cloud deployments**. Since v9.1.0, [Cloud users could disable the Admin API](https://mockoon.com/releases/9.1.0/#cloud-deployments) when deploying, but we've **reverted** this option.

The admin API will be a central part of the new web app we are working on, and we need it to be always available to ensure a seamless experience. The API will always be protected by an API key, regardless of whether your deployment is public or private. We updated the documentation to reflect this change.

(Issue [#1688](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1688))

## Command palette: search across all environments

The **command palette** has been updated to improve navigation and usability. You can now **search for endpoints across all opened environments**, making it easier to find and jump to the right route, no matter which environment it belongs to.

## Filter added to route response list

A new **filter** is now available in the **route response list**, making it easier to quickly find and manage specific responses within your routes.

## Quick access to recently opened local environments

We've added a list of **recently opened local environments**, making it easier to quickly reopen your most used environments without searching for them manually.

## Admin API improvements

The admin API now returns the data buckets statuses in a new `GET /mockoon-admin/data-buckets` endpoint:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "jb18",
    "name": "data 1",
    "parsed": true,
    "validJson": true
  },
  {
    "id": "fhcj",
    "name": "data 2",
    "parsed": true,
    "validJson": false
  }
]
```

(Issue [#1673](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1673))

We also added a new **Server-sent events (SSE) endpoint** to the admin API to **receive the logs and the buckets statuses (above)** in real-time. The endpoint is `GET /mockoon-admin/events`. Check the [documentation](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/admin-api/events/) for more information.

(Issues [#1674](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1674) and [#1703](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1703))

Finally, the admin API now always include CORS headers to allow cross-origin requests and integration with web applications. (Issue [#1675](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1675))

## Improvements

- Add support for JSONPath `$[?(@.prop.match(/value/))]` filter expressions. (Issue [#1631](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1631))
- Environments imported from an OpenAPI specification now automatically include CORS headers if not present. (Issue [#1593](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1593))
- We've added a new [`find` templating helper](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-helpers/#find). (Issue [#1124](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1124))

## Fixes

- Fixed a bug introduced with v9.1.0 where rules targeting the JSON request body with an empty path wouldn't match. (Issue [#1628](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1628))
- Fixed a bug preventing matching JSON request bodies against string values. (Issue [#1658](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1658))
- We updated our Docker CLI base image to fix a vulnerability. (Issue [#1660](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1660))
- We updated the Snap package to Core 22 in order to fix a bug where system fonts were not loaded. (Issue [#1671](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1671))
- [**⚠️ Possible breaking change**] We fixed a path traversal vulnerability when file paths were built from request templating helpers (`queryParam`, `body`, etc.). It is not possible anymore to dynamically escape the current folder by passing `../` in the file path. Note: our cloud wasn't affected by this vulnerability, and your self-hosted instances are only at risk if publicly exposed and using request templating helpers in a file path. (Issue [#1699](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1699))

## Chores

- We updated the libraries and applications dependencies to their latest versions. As a result, we updated Faker.js to v9.6.0 (from v9.3.0) (see Faker.js [release notes](https://github.com/faker-js/faker/releases)).
