## Support us!

Mockoon is proudly **independent** and **open-source**, maintained without external funding. We rely on both **sponsorships** and **Mockoon Cloud subscriptions** to keep improving the project and building new features. A **big thank you** to the companies below for supporting our work and helping us grow (and all the [sponsors](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/blob/main/backers.md) who helped this project over time!):

## Cloud: Self-host cloud environment with the CLI

Team and Enterprise Mockoon Cloud subscribers can now **self-host Mockoon Cloud environments** they collaborate on using Mockoon CLI.

To do so, open the application dialog from the environment dropdown and follow the instructions to pull the environment using the CLI:

You will be able to pull the environment using the `mockoon-cli start` command and by providing an access token and the Cloud environment identifier. Access tokens can be created from your [account settings](https://mockoon.com/account/access-tokens/).

More information about this new feature can be found in the [documentation](https://mockoon.com/cloud/docs/api-mock-cloud-deployments/#self-host-with-the-cli).

Two modifications were made to the CLI to support this feature:

- the [`--data` flag](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/tree/main/packages/cli#start-command) now accepts **Cloud environment identifiers** `cloud://{uuid}` to differentiate them from local environment files.
- a new [`--token` flag](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/tree/main/packages/cli#start-command) was added to provide the access token needed to pull Cloud environments.

(Issue [#1736](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1736))

## Callbacks now support relative URLs

To make it easier to call endpoints within the same mock, **relative URLs are now supported in callbacks**:

The relative URL will be constructed using the mock's hostname and port, for example: `/test-callback` will be called as `http://localhost:3000/test-callback` if the mock is running on `localhost:3000`.

When using the CLI or Docker image you can **customize the base URL** using the [`--public-base-url` flag](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/tree/main/packages/cli#start-command) (e.g. `mockoon-cli start ... --public-base-url=https://my-mock.example.org`). On Mockoon Cloud, the base URL will always be the unique URL assigned to your cloud instance.

(Issue [#1730](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1730))

## Copy curl command from the logs tab

You can now **copy a curl command from the logs tab** to easily reproduce requests made to your mock APIs. Select "Copy as curl" from the log entry context menu to copy the command to your clipboard:

The generated command includes the request method, URL, headers and body, for example:

```bash
curl --location --compressed --request GET "https://mock-1234.mockoon.app/test" --header "host: mock-1234.mockoon.app" --header "user-agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/143.0.0.0 Safari/537.36"
```

(Issue [#1458](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1458))

## Improvements

- The [`baseUrl` templating helper](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-request-helpers/#baseurl) will use the **`--public-base-url` flag value** when running with the CLI or Docker image to generate URLs consistent with the mock's public URL. (Issue [#1488](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1488))
- We optimized the OpenAPI parser when importing large OpenAPI files to reduce memory consumption and speed up the import process. (Issue [#1994](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1994))
- The OpenAPI parser now correctly imports endpoints with dashes in their path parameters (e.g. `/users/{user-id}`). (Issue [#2012](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/2012))
- When importing an OpenAPI endpoint with an `application/problem+json` example response body is now created. (Issue [#2009](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/2009))

## Fixes

- The application does not show non-existing tabs when navigating between routes of different types (HTTP, WebSocket, etc.). (Issue [#1893](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1893))
- The UI correctly displays the port in the environment menu and settings when a hostname is set. (Issue [#1910](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1910))
- Fixed telemetry not being sent for unauthenticated users. (Issue [#1965](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1965))
- The cloud logs are now replayed in the correct order, from most recent to oldest. (Issue [#1966](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1966))
- Resizing menus cannot trigger items drag and drop anymore. (Issue [#1964](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1964))
- When redeploying a Cloud environment, the region selection dropdown is now correctly set to the current region. (Issue [#1982](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/1982))

## Chores

- We **updated the libraries and applications dependencies** to their latest versions to fix several vulnerabilities.
