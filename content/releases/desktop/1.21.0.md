## Dialogs default directory

Until now, the save and open dialogs were pointing by default on a fresh install to the folder containing the binary. This folder may be wiped on some systems at each update which could cause data loss.
The dialogs now opens to the application's data folder and save their current working directory like it should. (Issue [#756](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/756))

## Templating helpers

We added a new [`parseInt`](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-helpers/#parseInt) helper. (Issue [#766](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/766))

## Fixes

- The `date` helper is now compatible with other helpers like the `queryParam`. (Issue [#781](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/781))
- Serving a file with an unknown mime type now correctly revert to the environment Content-Type. (Issue [#785](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/785))
- Duplicating a route to an environment now corretly save the new route in the environment JSON file. (Issue [#790](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/790))

## Improvements

We improved the menus resizer visibility. (Issue [#729](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/729))
