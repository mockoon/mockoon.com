In this tutorial, we will learn how to **implement rate limiting** in your Mockoon APIs using **custom templates** and **rules** to control request frequency and protect your endpoints from abuse.

Rate limiting is a crucial technique used to **control the number of requests** a client can make to an API within a specific time window. It helps prevent abuse, ensures fair usage, and protects your API from being overwhelmed.

In Mockoon, you can implement rate limiting using **global variables** to track request timestamps and counters, combined with **template helpers** and **response rules** to enforce the limits.

Let's explore different approaches to implement rate limiting, from simple time-based limits to more complex quota systems.

> 💡 This tutorial assumes you are familiar with the basics of Mockoon, like creating endpoints and using templates. If you are new to Mockoon, you can check the other [tutorials](/tutorials/) to get started.

> ⚠️ This tutorial requires v9.4.0 or later of Mockoon. You can download the latest version of Mockoon [here](https://mockoon.com/download/).

## 1. Simple time-based rate limiting with templates

The simplest form of rate limiting is to **limit requests based on time intervals**. We'll create an endpoint that allows only one request every 500 milliseconds.

### Create a new endpoint

First, let's create a new HTTP `GET` route with the path `/rate-limited`:

### Add the rate limiting template

In the **response body**, add the following template that implements time-based rate limiting:

```handlebars
{{#if (lt (subtract (now 'T') (getGlobalVar 'lastCall')) 500)}}
  {{status 429}}
  { "error": "Rate limit exceeded", "message": "Please wait at least 500ms between requests", "retry_after": 500 }
{{else}}
  { "success": true, "message": "Request processed successfully", "timestamp":
  {{now 'T'}}
  }
{{/if}}

{{setGlobalVar 'lastCall' (now 'T')}}
```

This template uses our [templating engine](/docs/latest/templating/overview/) and does the following:

- **Checks the time difference** between the current request and the last request using the following helpers: [`lt`](/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-helpers/#lt), [`subtract`](/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-helpers/#subtract), [`now`](/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-helpers/#now) and [`getGlobalVar`](/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-variables-helpers/#getglobalvar).
- **Returns a 429 status** (Too Many Requests) if the interval is less than 500ms using the [`status`](/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-response-helpers/#status) helper.
- **Updates the timestamp** for the next request using the [`setGlobalVar`](/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-variables-helpers/#setglobalvar) helper.
- **Provides helpful information** about the rate limit in the JSON response.

## 2. Rule-based rate limiting with multiple responses and a rule

For more complex scenarios, you can use [**response rules**](/docs/latest/route-responses/dynamic-rules/) to serve different responses based on rate limiting conditions. The following example will use the same template as above but will use a **response rule** instead of conditional templating.

### Create a new endpoint with multiple responses

Create a new HTTP `GET` route with the path `/rate-limited-rules`:

![new HTTP POST route showing the path /protected{1144x279}](/images/tutorials/implement-rate-limiting-custom-templates/create-rate-limited-rules-endpoint.png)

### Add the default rate-limited response

The [**default response**](/docs/latest/route-responses/multiple-responses/#default-route-response) will handle rate-limited requests with a **429 status code and the following JSON body**:

```json
{
  "error": "Rate limit exceeded",
  "message": "Too many requests.",
  "retry_after": 500
}
```

Set the status code to **429** for this response:

![view of the response returning a 429 error{1281x550}](/images/tutorials/implement-rate-limiting-custom-templates/default-429-response.png)

### Add a successful response with rate limiting rule

Add a **new response** by clicking the "Add response" button. Set the status code to **200** and add the following successful response JSON body:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Request processed successfully"
}
```

Now, click the "Rules" tab and add a **"Custom templating"** rule to check if enough time has passed since the last request. Custom rules allow you to define a **target value** to be evaluated using our [templating engine](/docs/latest/templating/overview/).
In the rule **target** field, enter:

```handlebars
{{gte (subtract (now 'T') (getGlobalVar 'lastCall')) 500}}{{setGlobalVar 'lastCall' (now 'T')}}
```

Then, set the rule value to `true`. This target will evaluate to `true` if at least 500 milliseconds have passed since the last request.

Similarly to the previous template, this rule does the following:

- **Checks if 500ms or more** have passed since the last call using the following helpers: [`gte`](/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-helpers/#gte), [`subtract`](/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-helpers/#subtract), [`now`](/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-helpers/#now) and [`getGlobalVar`](/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-variables-helpers/#getglobalvar).
- **Updates the timestamp** when the condition is met using the [`setGlobalVar`](/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-variables-helpers/#setglobalvar) helper.
- **Only serves the 200 response** when the template evaluates to `true`.

## 3. Testing your rate limiting implementations

To **test your rate limiting**, start your mock API server and use your favorite HTTP client to send multiple requests in quick succession.

### Testing the simple time-based limit

Send multiple `GET` requests to `GET /rate-limited` or `GET /rate-limited-rules` quickly:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/rate-limited
```

You should see:

- **First request**: Success response (200)
- **Immediate second request**: Rate limited response (429)
- **Request after 500ms**: Success response (200)

## 4. Advanced quota-based rate limiting

For more sophisticated rate limiting, let's implement a **quota system** that allows a configurable number of requests per time period.

### Create a data bucket for configuration

First, create a new [**data bucket**](/docs/latest/data-buckets/overview/) to store the rate limiting configuration. Data buckets allow you to store and manage JSON data that can be **accessed and manipulated in your templates and rules**.

Go to the "Data" view, click "Add data", name it "rate_config" and add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "last_request_timestamps": [],
  "max_requests_per_seconds": 2
}
```

![view of the new data bucket showing the above JSON template{1259x327}](/images/tutorials/implement-rate-limiting-custom-templates/rate-config-data-bucket.png)

This configuration allows **2 requests per second** and will be used to track the timestamps of the last requests in the `last_request_timestamps` array.

### Create the quota-limited endpoint

Create a new HTTP `GET` route with the path `/quota-limited`:

Add the following advanced template to implement quota-based rate limiting:

```handlebars
{{setVar 'currentTime' (now 'T')}}
{{setVar 'previousRequests' (dataRaw 'rate_config' 'last_request_timestamps')}}
{{setVar 'maxRequests' (dataRaw 'rate_config' 'max_requests_per_seconds')}}

{{setVar 'filteredTimestamps' (jmesPath (getVar 'previousRequests') (concat '[?to_number(@) > `' (subtract (getVar 'currentTime') 1000) '`]'))}}

{{#if (gte (len (getVar 'filteredTimestamps')) (getVar 'maxRequests'))}}
  {{status 429}}
  { "error": "Quota exceeded", "message": "You have exceeded the rate limit of
  {{getVar 'maxRequests'}}
  per second." }
{{else}}
  { "success": true, "message": "Request processed successfully" }
{{/if}}

{{setData 'push' 'rate_config' 'last_request_timestamps' (now 'T')}}
```

This template does the following:

- **Saves the current time** and retrieves the previous request timestamps and the maximum requests per second from the `rate_config` data bucket using the [`dataRaw`](/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-helpers/#dataraw), [`setVar`](/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-variables-helpers/#setvar) and [`now`](/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-helpers/#jmespath) helpers.
- **Filters the timestamps** to only include those within the last second using the [`jmesPath`](/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-helpers/#jmespath) helper.
- **Checks if the number of requests** in the last second exceeds the configured limit using the [`len`](/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-helpers/#len) and [`gte`](/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-helpers/#gte) helpers.
- **Returns a 429 status** (Too Many Requests) if the limit is exceeded, providing a detailed error message.
- **Pushes the last request timestamps** in the `rate_config` array using the [`setData`](/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-helpers/#setdata) helper.

![view of the above template in the user interface{1563x623}](/images/tutorials/implement-rate-limiting-custom-templates/quota-template-response.png)

### Testing the quota-based limit

Send multiple `GET` requests to `/quota-limited`:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/quota-limited
```

You should see a 429 response if you exceed the configured limit of 2 requests per second. The response will include information about the number of requests allowed.

## Going further

After completing this tutorial, you can enhance your rate limiting implementation by:

- **rate limiting based on user IP** or other request attributes by storing request timestamps in a user-specific data bucket property, using the [`header`](/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-request-helpers/#header) or [`queryParam`](/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-request-helpers/#queryparam) helpers.

- **Implementing more complex quota systems** with different limits for different endpoints using a [`request path rule`](/docs/latest/route-responses/dynamic-rules/#1-target) to serve different rate limits based on the request path.
