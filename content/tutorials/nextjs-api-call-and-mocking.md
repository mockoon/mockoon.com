This guide will teach you how to call any REST API from your Next.js application. If you already have an existing API that you want to use, you can skip the first step, in which we create a fake REST API using Mockoon.

## 1. Create a mock API endpoint with Mockoon

When working on your Next.js application, you may need to mock an API that doesn't exists yet, or is only partially available (see [partial mocking with the proxy mode](docs:server-configuration/proxy-mode)). For this, the easiest way is to create a mock API using a tool like Mockoon. (Read more about the [benefits of API mocking](/use-cases/)).

> To learn more about how to set up your first mock API with Mockoon, head over to the [Getting started tutorial](/tutorials/getting-started/).

For the rest of the tutorial, we will use an array of fake blog posts. In Mockoon, create a `GET /posts` API endpoint that returns an array of blog posts:

![create a mock API endpoint{1261x704}](/images/tutorials/blog-posts-mock-endpoint.png)

You can use the following JSON as the body returned by the endpoint:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "My first blog post"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "title": "My second blog post"
  }
]
```

Note that your fake mock server will be available at the following URL: `http://localhost:3000`. This is the URL we will need to use in our Next.js page.

## 2. Make a call to the API endpoint in your Next.js page

After creating a mock REST API endpoint in Mockoon, you can now call it from your Next.js page.
To do so, we need to use either the `getStaticProps` or the `getServerSideProps` functions. You can read more about these functions in the [official documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching).

Using the `getStaticProps` function will allow you to pre-render the page at build time using the props returned by `getStaticProps`:

```javascript
export async function getStaticProps(context) {
  // We will fetch the blog posts here

  return {
    props: {} // props will be passed to the page
  };
}
```

To fetch our blog posts from the mock API, we can use the `fetch` function and add the resulting data in the returned props:

```javascript
export async function getStaticProps(context) {
  // fetch the blog posts from the mock API
  const res = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/posts');
  const posts = await res.json();

  return {
    props: { posts } // props will be passed to the page
  };
}
```

## 3. Use the `posts` prop in your page

We can now render our blog posts on the page as `<li>` using a simple `map` loop:

```javascript
function HomePage({ posts }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <li>{post.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

## Use Next.js's environment variables

To avoid modifying the server URL directly in the Next.js page's code, you can put this URL in Next.js's [environment variables](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables).
To do so, create an environment variable in your `.env.local` or `.env.development` file:

```text
# .env.local file
API_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

You can then use the environment variable exposed by Next.js through the `process.env` object in the `getStaticProps` function:

```javascript
export async function getStaticProps(context) {
  // fetch the blog posts from the mock API using the environment variable
  const res = await fetch(`${process.env.API_URL}/posts`);
  const posts = await res.json();

  return {
    props: { posts } // props will be passed to the page
  };
}
```
