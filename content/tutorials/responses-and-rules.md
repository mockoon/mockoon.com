Mockoon allows you to create **multiple responses** for each mock API endpoint and serve them using **dynamic rules**. This tutorial will show you how to create a typical setup: one response returning a **200 status code** and another one returning a **401 status code** when the "Authorization" header is not present in the request.

## Step 1. Create a new route

The first step is to **create a new HTTP route** by clicking on the blue "Add route" button and selecting "HTTP route"

![add route menu with http route entry selected{619x249}](/images/tutorials/route-responses-rules/add-http-route.png)

When you create a new HTTP endpoint, there is always at least **one default response** with a 200 status code. The [default response](docs:route-responses/multiple-responses#default-route-response) is always marked with a **blue flag** and is served when no rule matches, when they are disabled, or simply when there are no other responses. We will keep the flag on this success response.

![Responses menu with the default response marked by a blue flag{1569x245}](/images/tutorials/route-responses-rules/default-route-response-blue-flag.png)

We can customize our new route by adding a simple body with a JSON response: `{ "response": "success" }`.

## Step 2. Add a "401 Unauthorized" response

The next step is to add a **second response** returning a **401 status code** when the **"Authorization"** header is missing from the request.

To add a new response, click on the blue "plus" button next to the response list:

![Add a response by clicking on the plus button{1580x309}](/images/tutorials/route-responses-rules/add-new-response.png)

You can also **duplicate** a response or **delete** it by clicking the buttons on the right.

The next step is to **customize** our response. Letâ€™s change the status code to **401 "Unauthorized"** which is the default status code for missing credentials.
You can also add a description, for example: "Error unauthorized".

Finally, we can customize the body with a simple JSON object: `{ "response": "error" }`.

## Step 3. Add a rule

The final step is to **add a rule** on the new **401** response to serve it only when the **"Authorization"** header is missing.

To add a rule, click on the **"Rules"** tab and then on the **"Add rule"** button:

![Add a new rule by clicking on the rule tab and the green add rule button{871x245}](/images/tutorials/route-responses-rules/add-rule.png)

In the new rule, select **"Header"** and enter **"Authorization"** as the **"Header name"**.

Finally, select **"null"** as the operator instead of "equals".

![Customize the rule by entering its target, name and value{871x245}](/images/tutorials/route-responses-rules/new-rule-customized.png)

You can now test your setup by **calling** your mock API with and without an Authorization header. You should see the **401 response** when the header is missing and the **200 response** when it is present. Here are two examples using **curl**:

```sh-sessions
$ curl http://localhost:3000/ -i
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 25
Date: Tue, 07 Feb 2023 15:07:59 GMT
Connection: keep-alive
Keep-Alive: timeout=5

{
  "response": "error"
}
```

```sh-sessions
$ curl http://localhost:3000/ -i -H "Authorization:abcd"
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 27
Date: Tue, 07 Feb 2023 15:04:58 GMT
Connection: keep-alive
Keep-Alive: timeout=5

{
  "response": "success"
}
```

## Step 4. Route responses modes

Three modes are also available next to the responses list: **random**, **sequential**, and **rules disabled**:

![Three buttons allows for random or sequential responses, or rules disabling{1254x309}](/images/tutorials/route-responses-rules/route-responses-modes.png)

Using these buttons, you can control how responses are served. The three modes are disabling the rules and changing the way responses are served:

- **Random**: responses will be served randomly.
- **Sequential**: responses will be served in the order they are displayed and will loop back to the first response when the last one is reached.
- **Rules disabled**: the rules will be ignored, and the default response will always be served.

## Step 5. Learn more

Now that you know how to create basic rules, you can head over to the [responses](docs:route-responses/multiple-responses) and [rules](docs:route-responses/dynamic-rules) documentation to learn more about these features.
