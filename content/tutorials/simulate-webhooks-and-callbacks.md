In this tutorial, we will learn how to **simulate webhooks or callbacks** in your mock API server. This feature is useful when you need to test your application's behavior when receiving asynchronous events from third-party services or APIs, like payment gateways or messaging services.

While **webhooks** and **callbacks** are similar concepts, they have some **differences**. Webhooks are used to **notify applications of an event**. They usually take the form of an API endpoint receiving a request with a payload, for example, when a payment is processed or a message is received. On the other hand, callbacks are used to **return a response** to a previous request, for example, when data are processed.

In Mockoon, these concepts are treated similarly and can be simulated using the same mechanism called **"Callbacks"**. Callbacks can be created in the "Callbacks" view. After creating a callback, you can **attach it** to an endpoint to trigger it when the endpoint is called.

Let's create a simple example with an **order creation in an e-commerce application**. We will create a new order creation endpoint that will trigger a callback when called. The callback will simulate payment processing and update the order status after a delay.

> üí° This tutorial assumes you are familiar with the basics of Mockoon, like creating endpoints and using templates. If you are new to Mockoon, you can check the other [tutorials](/tutorials/) to get started.

## 1. Create a new data bucket to store orders

The first step is to **create a new [data bucket](/docs/latest/data-buckets/overview/)** to store the orders. A data bucket is like a **simple JSON database** that can be used to store and share data between endpoints.

Go to the "Data" view, click on the "Add new data bucket" button, and name it "orders":

![new data bucket named orders{1077x190}](/images/tutorials/simulate-webhooks-and-callbacks/new-orders-data-bucket.png)

You can keep the default content of the data bucket (an ampty array `[]`).

## 2. Create a new "order" endpoint

The next step is to **create a new endpoint** that will simulate an order creation in your application. This endpoint will store a new order in our data bucket and later trigger the callback. Let's create a new HTTP `POST` route with the path `/orders` and add a template to the response body to simulate the order creation in the data bucket and return the new order:

```json
{{setData 'push' 'orders' null (object orderId='123456' status='pending')}}

{
  "orderId": "123456",
  "status": "pending"
}
```

> üí° Note the `null` argument in the `setData` helper in place of the key as we want to push at the root level of the data bucket.

Here is a screenshot of the new endpoint with the method, path, and template set:

## 3. Create a GET endpoint to retrieve the orders

To check the order was **correctly inserted** in the data bucket, let's create a new `GET` endpoint to **retrieve all the orders**. This step is not necessarily required but will help us test our workflow. Create an HTTP GET route with the path `/orders`. Here too, we will use a short template to return the orders stored in the data bucket:

```json
{{data 'orders'}}
```

> üí° The [`data` helper](/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-helpers/#data) already stringifies the data bucket content, so you don't need to do it yourself with a `stringify` helper.

Your new endpoint should look like this:

![new HTTP GET route showing the path /orders{1077x481}](/images/tutorials/simulate-webhooks-and-callbacks/create-get-orders-endpoint.png)

## 4. Create a new webhook endpoint

We now need to create a **new endpoint** that will **receive the webhook** from the simulated payment gateway. This endpoint will update our order status. Let's create a new HTTP `POST` route with the path `/webhook` and add a template to update the order status in the data bucket:

```json
{{setData 'set' 'orders' '0.status' 'paid'}}
```

Your webhook endpoint should look like this:

![new HTTP POST route showing the path /webhook{1079x493}](/images/tutorials/simulate-webhooks-and-callbacks/create-webhook-endpoint.png)

## 5. Create a new callback

We are now ready to **create the callback** that will **simulate a delayed response** from a payment gateway. Go to the "Callbacks" view and click on the "Add new callback" button. Name it "Payment processing". In the callback's method field, select "POST" and set the URL to `http://localhost:3000/webhook`:

![new callback named Payment processing{1077x403}](/images/tutorials/simulate-webhooks-and-callbacks/create-payment-processing-callback.png)

> üìù Do not forget to **set the port** to the one you are using for your mock API server. In this example, we are using the default port `3000`.

## 6. Attach the callback to the order creation endpoint

To simulate a payment processing happening after an order is created, we need to **attach the callback to the order creation endpoint** (`POST /orders`). To do so, go back to the "Routes" view, select the order creation endpoint, and click on the "Callbacks" tab in the response view. Select the "Payment processing" callback, and **add a delay of 10 seconds**:

![view of the order creation endpoint with the Payment processing callback attached{1074x345}](/images/tutorials/simulate-webhooks-and-callbacks/attach-callback-to-order-endpoint.png)

## 7. Test the workflow

To **test your new workflow**, first **start your mock API server** (using the "Play" arrow at the top). Then, using your favorite HTTP client (like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/), or [curl](https://curl.se/)), send a `POST` request to the `/orders` endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/orders
```

You can then check the order was correctly inserted by sending a `GET` request to the `/orders` endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/orders
```

You should see the order with the **status "pending"**:

```json
[
  {
    "orderId": "123456",
    "status": "pending"
  }
]
```

**After 10 seconds**, the callback will be **triggered** and the order status will be **updated to "paid"**. You can verify the new status by sending another `GET` request to the `/orders` endpoint:

```json
[
  {
    "orderId": "123456",
    "status": "paid"
  }
]
```

Finally, you can check the **request logs** in the "Logs" view to see if the webhook was triggered:

## Next steps

You now know how to simulate webhooks and callbacks in your mock API server. You can use this feature to test your application's behavior when receiving asynchronous events from third-party services or APIs.

You can also extend this example by generating order IDs dynamically, adding more data to the orders, or simulating other events like order shipping or order cancellation.
