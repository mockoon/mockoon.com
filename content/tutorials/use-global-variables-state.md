In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the global variables to save the state between requests in Mockoon. Global variables are a powerful feature that allows you to store and reuse data across multiple requests, contrarily to [local variables](/docs/latest/variables/local-variables/), scoped to a template. It can be useful when you simulate complex workflows like user authentication, shopping carts, or any other scenario where you save data between requests.

## Scope and support

Global variables are available [everywhere templating helpers are supported](docs:templating/overview): response body, rules, etc.

> üí° While you can use global variables in data buckets, keep in mind that bucket content will be [generated when the server starts](docs:data-buckets/overview#data-buckets-generation), when global variables are not yet set.

Once set, global variables are **shared** between **all routes** of an environment and available during all requests. Their values are **reset** when the environment is **stopped or restarted**.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è These variables are **not shared between environments**.

## 1. Set a global variable

To set a global variable, you can use the [`setGlobalVar` templating helper](/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-variables-helpers/#setglobalvar). This helper takes two arguments: the variable name and its value. You can **dynamically set the parameters** using other helpers.

Some examples:

```handlebars
<!-- Setting a simple variable -->
{{setGlobalVar 'varName' 'value'}}

<!-- Getting the value from the request body -->
{{setGlobalVar 'varName' (bodyRaw 'id')}}

<!-- Getting the name and value from a query parameter and the request body -->
{{setGlobalVar (queryParam 'param1') (bodyRaw 'id')}}
```

## 2. Get a global variable

To get a global variable, you can use the [`getGlobalVar` templating helper](/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-variables-helpers/#getglobalvar). This helper takes two arguments: the variable name and an optional path. Here too, you can **dynamically set the parameters** using other helpers and you can use the fetched data in other helpers.

Some examples:

```handlebars
<!-- Getting a variable -->
{{getGlobalVar 'varname'}}

<!-- Getting a variable content's properties using the JSONPath syntax -->
{{getGlobalVar 'varName' '$.array.[*].property'}}

<!-- Getting the name of the variable from the request body -->
{{getGlobalVar (bodyRaw 'property')}}

<!-- Using the variable content in an each helper (if the content is an array) -->
{{#each (getGlobalVar 'varName')}}...{{/each}}

<!-- Stringify the variable content -->
{{{stringify (getGlobalVar 'varName')}}}
```

> üìò Head over to the [global variables documentation](/docs/latest/variables/global-variables/) where you will find more examples.

## 3. Clear the global variables

To clear all the global variables, use the `PURGE /mockoon-admin/global-vars` or `POST /mockoon-admin/global-vars/purge` endpoints from the [admin API](docs:admin-api/global-variables).

## 4. An example use case: user authentication

Let's see how to use global variables to simulate a simple **user authentication workflow**. We will create two routes: one to log in and one to get the user's profile. We will use a global variable to store a boolean value indicating if the user is authenticated.

### Create the login route

First, create a new route `POST /login` to simulate a user logging in. Set the route with the following settings:

- **Method**: POST
- **Path**: `login`
- **Response body**:

  ```json
  {{setGlobalVar 'isAuthenticated' true}}

  {
    "message": "Login successful"
  }
  ```

![#sub#Overview of the login route with status 200 and "successful" body{1161x533}](/images/tutorials/use-global-variables-state/create-login-route.png)

### Create the profile route

Then, create a new `GET /profile` route to simulate **retrieving a user profile**. For this route, we will check if the user is authenticated before returning the profile using **two responses** and a **rule**.

First, create a new **HTTP route** and set the following settings:

- **Method**: GET
- **Path**: `profile`
- **Status**: 401
- **Response body**:

  ```json
  {
    "message": "Unauthorized"
  }
  ```

This will be our **default response** when the user is **not authenticated**. You can set the status to 401 to indicate that the user is not authorized to access the resource.

> üìò Head over to the related documentation to learn more about [creating multiple responses](/docs/latest/route-responses/multiple-responses/) and the [default route response](/docs/latest/route-responses/multiple-responses/#default-route-response).

Then, **add a new response** by clicking on the "plus" button next to the response list:

![Add a new response to the profile route{957x126}](/images/tutorials/use-global-variables-state/add-route-response.png)

Set the following settings to the new response:

- **Status**: 200 (it should be the default)
- **Response body**, generating a fake user profile:

  ```json
  {
    "name": "{{faker 'person.firstName'}} {{faker 'person.lastName'}}",
    "email": "{{faker 'internet.email'}}",
    "address": "{{faker 'address.streetAddress'}}",
    "phone": "{{faker 'phone.number'}}"
  }
  ```

### Add a rule to check if the user is authenticated

At this stage, we have two responses for the `GET /profile` route:

- The first one with a status of 401 indicates that the user is not authenticated. It should be the default response marked with a blue flag in the response list.
- The second one, with a status of 200 returns the user profile. It should be the second response in the list.

If you test the route now by making a `GET` call to `/profile`, you will always receive the 401 response because this is the **default response**, and there is no rule to check if the user is authenticated yet.

![#sub#The responses list{957x126}](/images/tutorials/use-global-variables-state/profile-route-responses.png)

To enable the user to access the profile only if they are authenticated (i.e. the `/login` route was called, and the global variable `isAuthenticated` is `true`), we need to add a rule on the second response to check the value of the global variable `isAuthenticated`.

To add the rule, first click on the second response in the list to edit it and click on the "Rules" tab:

![#sub#The response rules tab{954x169}](/images/tutorials/use-global-variables-state/profile-route-response-rules-tab.png)

Finally, add a new **rule** to the route to check if the user is authenticated. Click on the "plus" button in the rules list and set the following settings:

- **Target** "Global variable"
- **Variable name**: `isAuthenticated`
- **Operator** "equals"
- **Value**: `true`

![#sub#Overview of the new rule{954x200}](/images/tutorials/use-global-variables-state/profile-route-rule.png)

> üìò Head over to the [rules documentation](/docs/latest/route-responses/dynamic-rules/) to learn more about creating rules in Mockoon
> .

### Test the workflow

Now that we have set up the routes and the rule, you can test the workflow.

1. Make a `GET` call to `/profile`. You should receive the 401 response with the "Unauthorized" message.
2. Make a `POST` call to `/login`. You should receive the 200 response with the "Login successful" message.
3. Make a `GET` call to `/profile` again. This time, you should receive the 200 response with the fake user profile.

![#sub#Overview of the profile route with status 200 and fake profile{1049x233}](/images/tutorials/use-global-variables-state/profile-route-200-response.png)

To reset the global variable `isAuthenticated` between tests, you can **restart** the mock API.
