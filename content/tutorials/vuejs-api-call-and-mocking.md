This tutorial will show you how to call a REST API from a simple Vue.js application created with the [create-vue](https://github.com/vuejs/create-vue) scaffolding tool. If you already have an existing API that you want to call from your application, you can skip the first step, in which we will create a fake REST API using Mockoon.

## 1. Create a mock API endpoint with Mockoon

When working on your Vue.js single page application, you may need to mock an API that is still under development, or that is only [partially available](docs:server-configuration/proxy-mode). The easiest way to start working without having to wait is to create a mock API using a tool like Mockoon. (Read more about the [benefits of API mocking](/use-cases/)).

> To learn more about how to set up your first mock API with Mockoon, head over to the [Getting started tutorial](/tutorials/getting-started/).

For the rest of the tutorial, we will use an array of fake blog posts with a single title. In Mockoon, create a `GET /posts` API route that returns an array of blog posts:

![create a mock API endpoint{1261x704}](/images/tutorials/blog-posts-mock-endpoint.png)

You can use the following JSON as the body returned by the endpoint:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "My first blog post"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "title": "My second blog post"
  }
]
```

Note that your fake mock API server will be available at the following URL: `http://localhost:3000`. It is the URL we will need to use in our Vue.js component.

## 2. Preparing our Vue.js component

For this tutorial, we created a new Vue.js application using the official scaffolding tool: `npm init vue@latest`. We answered "no" to all the questions to keep the setup simple.

In the rest of this tutorial, we will use the main `./src/App.vue` file that was automatically created.
First, let's "clean" the component a bit by removing the demo content. We will remove the imports and most of the HTML:

```html
<script>
  /* Remove imports */
</script>

<template>
  <!-- <header>...</header> -->

  <main>
    <!-- Remove <TheWelcome /> -->
  </main>
</template>
```

## 3. Make a call to the API endpoint in your Vue.js component

After preparing our `./src/App.vue` component and creating a mock REST API endpoint in Mockoon, you can now call it from your component.

To make an AJAX call to an API, we need to use a library or the browser's built-in [`window.fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) function. We will be using the `fetch` function as it is available in most browsers.

You will find below the minimal code needed to call our API endpoint with this function:

```javascript
fetch('http://localhost:3000/posts')
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then((posts) => {
    // we received our list of posts
    console.log(posts);
  });
```

We need to integrate this code into our component. However, we need to first prepare the initial reactive state (`data`) for our posts, and a `created` method using Vue's Options API, in which we will fetch our data at component's creation time.

```html
<script>
  export default {
    data() {
      return {
        posts: []
      };
    },
    created() {
      // we will fetch our posts here, when the component is created
    }
  };
</script>
```

## 4. Fetch the data and store the result in the reactive state

We can now add our `fetch` function to the `created` method and store the result in the component's state:

```html
<script>
  export default {
    data() {
      return {
        posts: []
      };
    },
    created() {
      fetch('http://localhost:3000/posts')
        .then((res) => res.json())
        .then((posts) => {
          // store the posts in the reactive state
          this.posts = posts;
        });
    }
  };
</script>
```

## 5. Use the `posts` state variable in your component's template

We can now render our blog posts on the page as `<li>` using a `v-for` directive:

```html
<template>
  <main>
    <ul>
      <li v-for="post in posts" :key="post.id">{{ post.title }}</li>
    </ul>
  </main>
</template>
```

Putting all this code together, we get a fully functional component loading asynchronous mock data:

```html
<script>
  export default {
    data() {
      return {
        posts: []
      };
    },
    created() {
      fetch('http://localhost:3000/posts')
        .then((res) => res.json())
        .then((posts) => {
          // store the posts in the reactive state
          this.posts = posts;
        });
    }
  };
</script>

<template>
  <main>
    <ul>
      <li v-for="post in posts" :key="post.id">{{ post.title }}</li>
    </ul>
  </main>
</template>
```
