                The data synchronization and real-time collaboration feature
                ("Synchronization Feature") is available to all our customers of

                We do not make any representation or warranty regarding the
                availability, performance, or functionality of the
                Synchronization Feature. The Synchronization Feature may be
                subject to downtime, errors, or interruptions, and we do not
                guarantee that it will be available at all times. We will make
                commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the availability and
                performance of the Synchronization Feature, and inform you of
                any planned maintenance or downtime through our Service status

              </p>
              <p>
                Aside from the above-mentioned quotas, the Synchronization
                Feature is subject to some technical limitations and monitoring,
                including but not limited to the maximum number of devices that
                can be synchronized from the same IP address, the maximum number
                of concurrent requests to our servers or the volume of data that
                can be transmitted over a certain period of time. These
                limitations are designed to ensure fair usage of our
                infrastructure and to prevent abuse or excessive load on our
                systems. We reserve the right to modify or adjust the technical
                limitations of the Synchronization Feature at any time. We
                further reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to
                the Synchronization Feature if we determine that your usage is
                unreasonable or causing an undue burden on our infrastructure.

                integrity of the data synchronized through the Synchronization
                Feature, it is not a backup service. We do not guarantee the

                The usage quotas allocated monthly to your account will reset at
                the beginning of each billing cycle. Unused quotas from the
                previous billing cycle will not be carried over to the next

                time, subject to providing you with reasonable advance notice if
                such modifications or adjustments are likely to have a material
                adverse effect on the availability, performance, or
                functionality of the Service. Such modifications or adjustments
                may be communicated through written notice, email notifications,
                or by posting the updated quotas within our Service.
